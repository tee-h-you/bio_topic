0,Three million images and morphological profiles of cells treated with matched chemical and genetic perturbations,"The identification of genetic and chemical perturbations with similar impacts on cell morphology can elucidate compounds’ mechanisms of action or novel regulators of genetic pathways. Research on methods for identifying such similarities has lagged due to a lack of carefully designed and well-annotated image sets of cells treated with chemical and genetic perturbations. Here we create such a Resource dataset, CPJUMP1, in which each perturbed gene’s product is a known target of at least two chemical compounds in the dataset. We systematically explore the directionality of correlations among perturbations that target the same protein encoded by a given gene, and we find that identifying matches between chemical and genetic perturbations is a challenging task. Our dataset and baseline analyses provide a benchmark for evaluating methods that measure perturbation similarities and impact, and more generally, learn effective representations of cellular state from microscopy images. Such advancements would accelerate the applications of image-based profiling of cellular states, such as uncovering drug mode of action or probing functional genomics."
1,"Teacher-student collaborated multiple instance learning for pan-cancer 
PDL1
 expression prediction from histopathology slides","Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1), as an important biomarker, is quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with few established histopathological patterns. Deep learning aids in histopathological assessment, yet heterogeneity and lacking spatially resolved annotations challenge precise analysis. Here, we present a weakly supervised learning approach using bulk RNA sequencing for 
PDL1
 expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Our method extends the multiple instance learning paradigm with the teacher-student framework, which assigns dynamic pseudo-labels for intra-slide heterogeneity and retrieves unlabeled instances using temporal ensemble model distillation. The approach, evaluated on 12,299 slides across 20 solid tumor types, achieves a weighted average area under the curve of 0.83 on fresh-frozen and 0.74 on formalin-fixed specimens for 9 tumors with PDL1 as an established biomarker. Our method predicts 
PDL1
 expression patterns, validated by IHC on 20 slides, offering insights into histologies relevant to PDL1. This demonstrates the potential of deep learning in identifying diverse histological patterns for molecular changes from H&E images."
2,Hot springs viruses at Yellowstone National Park have ancient origins and are adapted to thermophilic hosts,"Geothermal springs house unicellular red algae in the class Cyanidiophyceae that dominate the microbial biomass at these sites. Little is known about host-virus interactions in these environments. We analyzed the virus community associated with red algal mats in three neighboring habitats (creek, endolithic, soil) at Lemonade Creek, Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA. We find that despite proximity, each habitat houses a unique collection of viruses, with the giant viruses, Megaviricetes, dominant in all three. The early branching phylogenetic position of genes encoded on metagenome assembled virus genomes (vMAGs) suggests that the YNP lineages are of ancient origin and not due to multiple invasions from mesophilic habitats. The existence of genomic footprints of adaptation to thermophily in the vMAGs is consistent with this idea. The Cyanidiophyceae at geothermal sites originated ca. 1.5 Bya and are therefore relevant to understanding biotic interactions on the early Earth."
3,Dynamic molecular network analysis of iPSC-Purkinje cells differentiation delineates roles of ISG15 in SCA1 at the earliest stage,"Better understanding of the earliest molecular pathologies of all neurodegenerative diseases is expected to improve human therapeutics. We investigated the earliest molecular pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a rare familial neurodegenerative disease that primarily induces death and dysfunction of cerebellum Purkinje cells. Extensive prior studies have identified involvement of transcription or RNA-splicing factors in the molecular pathology of SCA1. However, the regulatory network of SCA1 pathology, especially central regulators of the earliest developmental stages and inflammatory events, remains incompletely understood. Here, we elucidated the earliest developmental pathology of SCA1 using originally developed dynamic molecular network analyses of sequentially acquired RNA-seq data during differentiation of SCA1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to Purkinje cells. Dynamic molecular network analysis implicated histone genes and cytokine-relevant immune response genes at the earliest stages of development, and revealed relevance of ISG15 to the following degradation and accumulation of mutant ataxin-1 in Purkinje cells of SCA1 model mice and human patients."
4,Nonlinear DNA methylation trajectories in aging male mice,"Although DNA methylation data yields highly accurate age predictors, little is known about the dynamics of this quintessential epigenomic biomarker during lifespan. To narrow the gap, we investigate the methylation trajectories of male mouse colon at five different time points of aging. Our study indicates the existence of sudden hypermethylation events at specific stages of life. Precisely, we identify two epigenomic switches during early-to-midlife (3-9 months) and mid-to-late-life (15-24 months) transitions, separating the rodents’ life into three stages. These nonlinear methylation dynamics predominantly affect genes associated with the nervous system and enrich in bivalently marked chromatin regions. Based on groups of nonlinearly modified loci, we construct a clock-like classifier STageR (STage of aging estimatoR) that accurately predicts murine epigenetic stage. We demonstrate the universality of our clock in an independent mouse cohort and with publicly available datasets."
5,Accurately clustering biological sequences in linear time by relatedness sorting,"Clustering biological sequences into similar groups is an increasingly important task as the number of available sequences continues to grow exponentially. Search-based approaches to clustering scale super-linearly with the number of input sequences, making it impractical to cluster very large sets of sequences. Approaches to clustering sequences in linear time currently lack the accuracy of super-linear approaches. Here, I set out to develop and characterize a strategy for clustering with linear time complexity that retains the accuracy of less scalable approaches. The resulting algorithm, named Clusterize, sorts sequences by relatedness to linearize the clustering problem. Clusterize produces clusters with accuracy rivaling popular programs (CD-HIT, MMseqs2, and UCLUST) but exhibits linear asymptotic scalability. Clusterize generates higher accuracy and oftentimes much larger clusters than Linclust, a fast linear time clustering algorithm. I demonstrate the utility of Clusterize by accurately solving different clustering problems involving millions of nucleotide or protein sequences."
6,scGHOST: identifying single-cell 3D genome subcompartments,"Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technologies allow for probing of genome-wide cell-to-cell variability in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization from individual cells. Computational methods have been developed to reveal single-cell 3D genome features based on scHi-C, including A/B compartments, topologically associating domains and chromatin loops. However, no method exists for annotating single-cell subcompartments, which is important for understanding chromosome spatial localization in single cells. Here we present scGHOST, a single-cell subcompartment annotation method using graph embedding with constrained random walk sampling. Applications of scGHOST to scHi-C data and contact maps derived from single-cell 3D genome imaging demonstrate reliable identification of single-cell subcompartments, offering insights into cell-to-cell variability of nuclear subcompartments. Using scHi-C data from complex tissues, scGHOST identifies cell-type-specific or allele-specific subcompartments linked to gene transcription across various cell types and developmental stages, suggesting functional implications of single-cell subcompartments. scGHOST is an effective method for annotating single-cell 3D genome subcompartments in a broad range of biological contexts."
7,Spike sorting with Kilosort4,"Spike sorting is the computational process of extracting the firing times of single neurons from recordings of local electrical fields. This is an important but hard problem in neuroscience, made complicated by the nonstationarity of the recordings and the dense overlap in electrical fields between nearby neurons. To address the spike-sorting problem, we have been openly developing the Kilosort framework. Here we describe the various algorithmic steps introduced in different versions of Kilosort. We also report the development of Kilosort4, a version with substantially improved performance due to clustering algorithms inspired by graph-based approaches. To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework that uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate nonstationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We found that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperformed other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions and that Kilosort4 performed best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions."
8,Comparative characterization of the infant gut microbiome and their maternal lineage by a multi-omics approach,"The human gut microbiome establishes and matures during infancy, and dysregulation at this stage may lead to pathologies later in life. We conducted a multi-omics study comprising three generations of family members to investigate the early development of the gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 200 individuals, including infants (0-12 months old; 55% females, 45% males) and their respective mothers and grandmothers, were analyzed using two independent metabolomics platforms and metagenomics. For metabolomics, gas chromatography and capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry were applied. For metagenomics, both 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing were performed. Here we show that infants greatly vary from their elders in fecal microbiota populations, function, and metabolome. Infants have a less diverse microbiota than adults and present differences in several metabolite classes, such as short- and branched-chain fatty acids, which are associated with shifts in bacterial populations. These findings provide innovative biochemical insights into the shaping of the gut microbiome within the same generational line that could be beneficial in improving childhood health outcomes."
9,Single-cell multiomics reveals the interplay of clonal evolution and cellular plasticity in hepatoblastoma,"Hepatoblastomas (HB) display heterogeneous cellular phenotypes that influence the clinical outcome, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we use a single-cell multiomic strategy to unravel the molecular determinants of this plasticity. We identify a continuum of HB cell states between hepatocytic (scH), liver progenitor (scLP) and mesenchymal (scM) differentiation poles, with an intermediate scH/LP population bordering scLP and scH areas in spatial transcriptomics. Chromatin accessibility landscapes reveal the gene regulatory networks of each differentiation pole, and the sequence of transcription factor activations underlying cell state transitions. Single-cell mapping of somatic alterations reveals the clonal architecture of each tumor, showing that each genetic subclone displays its own range of cellular plasticity across differentiation states. The most scLP subclones, overexpressing stem cell and DNA repair genes, proliferate faster after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. These results highlight how the interplay of clonal evolution and epigenetic plasticity shapes the potential of HB subclones to respond to chemotherapy."
10,Engineering an artificial catch bond using mechanical anisotropy,"Catch bonds are a rare class of protein-protein interactions where the bond lifetime increases under an external pulling force. Here, we report how modification of anchor geometry generates catch bonding behavior for the mechanostable Dockerin G:Cohesin E (DocG:CohE) adhesion complex found on human gut bacteria. Using AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy in combination with bioorthogonal click chemistry, we mechanically dissociate the complex using five precisely controlled anchor geometries. When tension is applied between residue #13 on CohE and the N-terminus of DocG, the complex behaves as a two-state catch bond, while in all other tested pulling geometries, including the native configuration, it behaves as a slip bond. We use a kinetic Monte Carlo model with experimentally derived parameters to simulate rupture force and lifetime distributions, achieving strong agreement with experiments. Single-molecule FRET measurements further demonstrate that the complex does not exhibit dual binding mode behavior at equilibrium but unbinds along multiple pathways under force. Together, these results show how mechanical anisotropy and anchor point selection can be used to engineer artificial catch bonds."
11,scButterfly: a versatile single-cell cross-modality translation method via dual-aligned variational autoencoders,"Recent advancements for simultaneously profiling multi-omics modalities within individual cells have enabled the interrogation of cellular heterogeneity and molecular hierarchy. However, technical limitations lead to highly noisy multi-modal data and substantial costs. Although computational methods have been proposed to translate single-cell data across modalities, broad applications of the methods still remain impeded by formidable challenges. Here, we propose scButterfly, a versatile single-cell cross-modality translation method based on dual-aligned variational autoencoders and data augmentation schemes. With comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we provide compelling evidence of scButterfly’s superiority over baseline methods in preserving cellular heterogeneity while translating datasets of various contexts and in revealing cell type-specific biological insights. Besides, we demonstrate the extensive applications of scButterfly for integrative multi-omics analysis of single-modality data, data enhancement of poor-quality single-cell multi-omics, and automatic cell type annotation of scATAC-seq data. Moreover, scButterfly can be generalized to unpaired data training, perturbation-response analysis, and consecutive translation."
12,Systematic HOIP interactome profiling reveals critical roles of linear ubiquitination in tissue homeostasis,"Linear ubiquitination catalyzed by HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP), the key component of the linear ubiquitination assembly complex, plays fundamental roles in tissue homeostasis by executing domain-specific regulatory functions. However, a proteome-wide analysis of the domain-specific interactome of HOIP across tissues is lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive mass spectrometry-based interactome profiling of four HOIP domains in nine mouse tissues. The interaction dataset provides a high-quality HOIP interactome resource with an average of approximately 90 interactors for each bait per tissue. HOIP tissue interactome presents a systematic understanding of linear ubiquitination functions in each tissue and also shows associations of tissue functions to genetic diseases. HOIP domain interactome characterizes a set of previously undefined linear ubiquitinated substrates and elucidates the cross-talk among HOIP domains in physiological and pathological processes. Moreover, we show that linear ubiquitination of Integrin-linked protein kinase (ILK) decreases focal adhesion formation and promotes the detachment of 
Shigella flexneri
-infected cells. Meanwhile, 
Hoip
 deficiency decreases the linear ubiquitination of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) and enhances its E3 activity, finally causing a reduced bone mass phenotype in mice. Overall, our work expands the knowledge of HOIP-interacting proteins and provides a platform for further discovery of linear ubiquitination functions in tissue homeostasis."
13,De novo diploid genome assembly using long noisy reads,"The high sequencing error rate has impeded the application of long noisy reads for diploid genome assembly. Most existing assemblers failed to generate high-quality phased assemblies using long noisy reads. Here, we present PECAT, a 
P
hased 
E
rror 
C
orrection and 
A
ssembly 
T
ool, for reconstructing diploid genomes from long noisy reads. We design a haplotype-aware error correction method that can retain heterozygote alleles while correcting sequencing errors. We combine a corrected read SNP caller and a raw read SNP caller to further improve the identification of inconsistent overlaps in the string graph. We use a grouping method to assign reads to different haplotype groups. PECAT efficiently assembles diploid genomes using Nanopore R9, PacBio CLR or Nanopore R10 reads only. PECAT generates more contiguous haplotype-specific contigs compared to other assemblers. Especially, PECAT achieves nearly haplotype-resolved assembly on 
B. taurus
 (Bison×Simmental) using Nanopore R9 reads and phase block NG50 with 59.4/58.0 Mb for HG002 using Nanopore R10 reads."
14,Unsupervised deep representation learning enables phenotype discovery for genetic association studies of brain imaging,"Understanding the genetic architecture of brain structure is challenging, partly due to difficulties in designing robust, non-biased descriptors of brain morphology. Until recently, brain measures for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisted of traditionally expert-defined or software-derived image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that are often based on theoretical preconceptions or computed from limited amounts of data. Here, we present an approach to derive brain imaging phenotypes using unsupervised deep representation learning. We train a 3-D convolutional autoencoder model with reconstruction loss on 6130 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants’ T1 or T2-FLAIR (T2) brain MRIs to create a 128-dimensional representation known as Unsupervised Deep learning derived Imaging Phenotypes (UDIPs). GWAS of these UDIPs in held-out UKBB subjects (n = 22,880 discovery and n = 12,359/11,265 replication cohorts for T1/T2) identified 9457 significant SNPs organized into 97 independent genetic loci of which 60 loci were replicated. Twenty-six loci were not reported in earlier T1 and T2 IDP-based UK Biobank GWAS. We developed a perturbation-based decoder interpretation approach to show that these loci are associated with UDIPs mapped to multiple relevant brain regions. Our results established unsupervised deep learning can derive robust, unbiased, heritable, and interpretable brain imaging phenotypes."
15,DeepDOF-SE: affordable deep-learning microscopy platform for slide-free histology,"Histopathology plays a critical role in the diagnosis and surgical management of cancer. However, access to histopathology services, especially frozen section pathology during surgery, is limited in resource-constrained settings because preparing slides from resected tissue is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires expensive infrastructure. Here, we report a deep-learning-enabled microscope, named DeepDOF-SE, to rapidly scan intact tissue at cellular resolution without the need for physical sectioning. Three key features jointly make DeepDOF-SE practical. First, tissue specimens are stained directly with inexpensive vital fluorescent dyes and optically sectioned with ultra-violet excitation that localizes fluorescent emission to a thin surface layer. Second, a deep-learning algorithm extends the depth-of-field, allowing rapid acquisition of in-focus images from large areas of tissue even when the tissue surface is highly irregular. Finally, a semi-supervised generative adversarial network virtually stains DeepDOF-SE fluorescence images with hematoxylin-and-eosin appearance, facilitating image interpretation by pathologists without significant additional training. We developed the DeepDOF-SE platform using a data-driven approach and validated its performance by imaging surgical resections of suspected oral tumors. Our results show that DeepDOF-SE provides histological information of diagnostic importance, offering a rapid and affordable slide-free histology platform for intraoperative tumor margin assessment and in low-resource settings."
16,"The recent rapid expansion of multidrug resistant Ural lineage 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 in Moldova","The projected trajectory of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics depends on the reproductive fitness of circulating strains of MDR 
M. tuberculosis (Mtb)
. Previous efforts to characterize the fitness of MDR 
Mtb
 have found that 
Mtb
 strains of the Beijing sublineage (Lineage 2.2.1) may be more prone to develop resistance and retain fitness in the presence of resistance-conferring mutations than other lineages. Using 
Mtb
 genome sequences from all culture-positive cases collected over two years in Moldova, we estimate the fitness of Ural (Lineage 4.2) and Beijing strains, the two lineages in which MDR is concentrated in the country. We estimate that the fitness of MDR Ural strains substantially exceeds that of other susceptible and MDR strains, and we identify several mutations specific to these MDR Ural strains. Our findings suggest that MDR Ural 
Mtb
 has been transmitting efficiently in Moldova and poses a substantial risk of spreading further in the region."
17,Context-aware deep learning enables high-efficacy localization of high concentration microbubbles for super-resolution ultrasound localization microscopy,"Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) enables deep tissue microvascular imaging by localizing and tracking intravenously injected microbubbles circulating in the bloodstream. However, conventional localization techniques require spatially isolated microbubbles, resulting in prolonged imaging time to obtain detailed microvascular maps. Here, we introduce LOcalization with Context Awareness (LOCA)-ULM, a deep learning-based microbubble simulation and localization pipeline designed to enhance localization performance in high microbubble concentrations. In silico, LOCA-ULM enhanced microbubble detection accuracy to 97.8% and reduced the missing rate to 23.8%, outperforming conventional and deep learning-based localization methods up to 17.4% in accuracy and 37.6% in missing rate reduction. In in vivo rat brain imaging, LOCA-ULM revealed dense cerebrovascular networks and spatially adjacent microvessels undetected by conventional ULM. We further demonstrate the superior localization performance of LOCA-ULM in functional ULM (fULM) where LOCA-ULM significantly increased the functional imaging sensitivity of fULM to hemodynamic responses invoked by whisker stimulations in the rat brain."
18,MIM-CyCIF: masked imaging modeling for enhancing cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) with panel reduction and imputation,"Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CyCIF) can quantify multiple biomarkers, but panel capacity is limited by technical challenges. We propose a computational panel reduction approach that can impute the information content from 25 markers using only 9 markers, learning co-expression and morphological patterns while concurrently increasing speed and panel content and decreasing cost. We demonstrate strong correlations in predictions and generalizability across breast and colorectal cancer, illustrating applicability of our approach to diverse tissue types."
19,Multi-Attribute Subset Selection enables prediction of representative phenotypes across microbial populations,"The interpretation of complex biological datasets requires the identification of representative variables that describe the data without critical information loss. This is particularly important in the analysis of large phenotypic datasets (phenomics). Here we introduce Multi-Attribute Subset Selection (MASS), an algorithm which separates a matrix of phenotypes (e.g., yield across microbial species and environmental conditions) into predictor and response sets of conditions. Using mixed integer linear programming, MASS expresses the response conditions as a linear combination of the predictor conditions, while simultaneously searching for the optimally descriptive set of predictors. We apply the algorithm to three microbial datasets and identify environmental conditions that predict phenotypes under other conditions, providing biologically interpretable axes for strain discrimination. MASS could be used to reduce the number of experiments needed to identify species or to map their metabolic capabilities. The generality of the algorithm allows addressing subset selection problems in areas beyond biology."
20,Genomic language model predicts protein co-regulation and function,"Deciphering the relationship between a gene and its genomic context is fundamental to understanding and engineering biological systems. Machine learning has shown promise in learning latent relationships underlying the sequence-structure-function paradigm from massive protein sequence datasets. However, to date, limited attempts have been made in extending this continuum to include higher order genomic context information. Evolutionary processes dictate the specificity of genomic contexts in which a gene is found across phylogenetic distances, and these emergent genomic patterns can be leveraged to uncover functional relationships between gene products. Here, we train a genomic language model (gLM) on millions of metagenomic scaffolds to learn the latent functional and regulatory relationships between genes. gLM learns contextualized protein embeddings that capture the genomic context as well as the protein sequence itself, and encode biologically meaningful and functionally relevant information (e.g. enzymatic function, taxonomy). Our analysis of the attention patterns demonstrates that gLM is learning co-regulated functional modules (i.e. operons). Our findings illustrate that gLM’s unsupervised deep learning of the metagenomic corpus is an effective and promising approach to encode functional semantics and regulatory syntax of genes in their genomic contexts and uncover complex relationships between genes in a genomic region."
21,VespAI: a deep learning-based system for the detection of invasive hornets,"The invasive hornet 
Vespa velutina nigrithorax
 is a rapidly proliferating threat to pollinators in Europe and East Asia. To effectively limit its spread, colonies must be detected and destroyed early in the invasion curve, however the current reliance upon visual alerts by the public yields low accuracy. Advances in deep learning offer a potential solution to this, but the application of such technology remains challenging. Here we present VespAI, an automated system for the rapid detection of 
V. velutina
. We leverage a hardware-assisted AI approach, combining a standardised monitoring station with deep YOLOv5s architecture and a ResNet backbone, trained on a bespoke end-to-end pipeline. This enables the system to detect hornets in real-time—achieving a mean precision-recall score of ≥0.99—and send associated image alerts via a compact remote processor. We demonstrate the successful operation of a prototype system in the field, and confirm its suitability for large-scale deployment in future use cases. As such, VespAI has the potential to transform the way that invasive hornets are managed, providing a robust early warning system to prevent ingressions into new regions."
22,"q

q

diffusion
, a framework for capturing the coexpression structure of an entire library of genes, improving on state-of-the-art analysis tools. The method is demonstrated via three case studies. In the first, 
q
-diffusion helps gain statistical significance for differential effects on patient outcomes when analyzing the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized phase III clinical trial, suggesting precision guidance for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Secondly, 
q
-diffusion is benchmarked against existing scRNAseq classification methods using an in vitro PBMC dataset, in which the proposed method discriminates IFN-
γ
 stimulation more accurately. The same case study demonstrates improvements in unsupervised cell clustering with the recent Tabula Sapiens human atlas. Finally, a local distributional segmentation approach for spatial scRNAseq, driven by 
q
-diffusion, yields interpretable structures of human cortical tissue."
23,Pianno: a probabilistic framework automating semantic annotation for spatial transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized the study of gene expression within tissues, while preserving spatial context. However, annotating spatial spots’ biological identity remains a challenge. To tackle this, we introduce Pianno, a Bayesian framework automating structural semantics annotation based on marker genes. Comprehensive evaluations underscore Pianno’s remarkable prowess in precisely annotating a wide array of spatial semantics, ranging from diverse anatomical structures to intricate tumor microenvironments, as well as in estimating cell type distributions, across data generated from various spatial transcriptomics platforms. Furthermore, Pianno, in conjunction with clustering approaches, uncovers a region- and species-specific excitatory neuron subtype in the deep layer 3 of the human neocortex, shedding light on cellular evolution in the human neocortex. Overall, Pianno equips researchers with a robust and efficient tool for annotating diverse biological structures, offering new perspectives on spatial transcriptomics data."
24,Early detection of emerging viral variants through analysis of community structure of coordinated substitution networks,"The emergence of viral variants with altered phenotypes is a public health challenge underscoring the need for advanced evolutionary forecasting methods. Given extensive epistatic interactions within viral genomes and known viral evolutionary history, efficient genomic surveillance necessitates early detection of emerging viral haplotypes rather than commonly targeted single mutations. Haplotype inference, however, is a significantly more challenging problem precluding the use of traditional approaches. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics as a case study, we show that emerging haplotypes with altered transmissibility can be linked to dense communities in coordinated substitution networks, which become discernible significantly earlier than the haplotypes become prevalent. From these insights, we develop a computational framework for inference of viral variants and validate it by successful early detection of known SARS-CoV-2 strains. Our methodology offers greater scalability than phylogenetic lineage tracing and can be applied to any rapidly evolving pathogen with adequate genomic surveillance data."
25,Reconstructing the evolution history of networked complex systems,"The evolution processes of complex systems carry key information in the systems’ functional properties. Applying machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that the historical formation process of various networked complex systems can be extracted, including protein-protein interaction, ecology, and social network systems. The recovered evolution process has demonstrations of immense scientific values, such as interpreting the evolution of protein-protein interaction network, facilitating structure prediction, and particularly revealing the key co-evolution features of network structures such as preferential attachment, community structure, local clustering, degree-degree correlation that could not be explained collectively by previous theories. Intriguingly, we discover that for large networks, if the performance of the machine learning model is slightly better than a random guess on the pairwise order of links, reliable restoration of the overall network formation process can be achieved. This suggests that evolution history restoration is generally highly feasible on empirical networks."
26,Data-driven identification of predictive risk biomarkers for subgroups of osteoarthritis using interpretable machine learning,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is increasing in prevalence and has a severe impact on patients’ lives. However, our understanding of biomarkers driving OA risk remains limited. We developed a model predicting the five-year risk of OA diagnosis, integrating retrospective clinical, lifestyle and biomarker data from the UK Biobank (19,120 patients with OA, ROC-AUC: 0.72, 95%CI (0.71–0.73)). Higher age, BMI and prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs contributed most to increased OA risk prediction ahead of diagnosis. We identified 14 subgroups of OA risk profiles. These subgroups were validated in an independent set of patients evaluating the 11-year OA risk, with 88% of patients being uniquely assigned to one of the 14 subgroups. Individual OA risk profiles were characterised by personalised biomarkers. Omics integration demonstrated the predictive importance of key OA genes and pathways (e.g., 
GDF5
 and TGF-β signalling) and OA-specific biomarkers (e.g., CRTAC1 and COL9A1). In summary, this work identifies opportunities for personalised OA prevention and insights into its underlying pathogenesis."
27,FinaleMe: Predicting DNA methylation by the fragmentation patterns of plasma cell-free DNA,"Analysis of DNA methylation in cell-free DNA reveals clinically relevant biomarkers but requires specialized protocols such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Meanwhile, millions of cell-free DNA samples are being profiled by whole-genome sequencing. Here, we develop FinaleMe, a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model, to predict DNA methylation of cell-free DNA and, therefore, tissues-of-origin, directly from plasma whole-genome sequencing. We validate the performance with 80 pairs of deep and shallow-coverage whole-genome sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data."
28,PLMSearch: Protein language model powers accurate and fast sequence search for remote homology,"Homologous protein search is one of the most commonly used methods for protein annotation and analysis. Compared to structure search, detecting distant evolutionary relationships from sequences alone remains challenging. Here we propose PLMSearch (

anguage 
M
odel), a homologous protein search method with only sequences as input. PLMSearch uses deep representations from a pre-trained protein language model and trains the similarity prediction model with a large number of real structure similarity. This enables PLMSearch to capture the remote homology information concealed behind the sequences. Extensive experimental results show that PLMSearch can search millions of query-target protein pairs in seconds like MMseqs2 while increasing the sensitivity by more than threefold, and is comparable to state-of-the-art structure search methods. In particular, unlike traditional sequence search methods, PLMSearch can recall most remote homology pairs with dissimilar sequences but similar structures. PLMSearch is freely available at

29,Procrustes is a machine-learning approach that removes cross-platform batch effects from clinical RNA sequencing data,"With the increased use of gene expression profiling for personalized oncology, optimized RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) protocols and algorithms are necessary to provide comparable expression measurements between exome capture (EC)-based and poly-A RNA-seq. Here, we developed and optimized an EC-based protocol for processing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and a machine-learning algorithm, Procrustes, to overcome batch effects across RNA-seq data obtained using different sample preparation protocols like EC-based or poly-A RNA-seq protocols. Applying Procrustes to samples processed using EC and poly-A RNA-seq protocols showed the expression of 61% of genes (
N
 = 20,062) to correlate across both protocols (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.8, versus 26% before transformation by Procrustes), including 84% of cancer-specific and cancer microenvironment-related genes (versus 36% before applying Procrustes; 
N
 = 1,438). Benchmarking analyses also showed Procrustes to outperform other batch correction methods. Finally, we showed that Procrustes can project RNA-seq data for a single sample to a larger cohort of RNA-seq data. Future application of Procrustes will enable direct gene expression analysis for single tumor samples to support gene expression-based treatment decisions."
30,Gene-expression memory-based prediction of cell lineages from scRNA-seq datasets,"Assigning single cell transcriptomes to cellular lineage trees by lineage tracing has transformed our understanding of differentiation during development, regeneration, and disease.

In human breast cancer biopsies, GEMLI reveals previously unknown gene expression changes at the onset of cancer invasiveness. The universal applicability of GEMLI allows studying the role of small cell lineages in a wide range of physiological and pathological contexts, notably in vivo. GEMLI is available as an R package on GitHub (

31,DELVE: feature selection for preserving biological trajectories in single-cell data,"Single-cell technologies can measure the expression of thousands of molecular features in individual cells undergoing dynamic biological processes. While examining cells along a computationally-ordered pseudotime trajectory can reveal how changes in gene or protein expression impact cell fate, identifying such dynamic features is challenging due to the inherent noise in single-cell data. Here, we present DELVE, an unsupervised feature selection method for identifying a representative subset of molecular features which robustly recapitulate cellular trajectories. In contrast to previous work, DELVE uses a bottom-up approach to mitigate the effects of confounding sources of variation, and instead models cell states from dynamic gene or protein modules based on core regulatory complexes. Using simulations, single-cell RNA sequencing, and iterative immunofluorescence imaging data in the context of cell cycle and cellular differentiation, we demonstrate how DELVE selects features that better define cell-types and cell-type transitions. DELVE is available as an open-source python package:

32,Hairpin trimer transition state of amyloid fibril,"Protein fibril self-assembly is a universal transition implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Although fibril structure/growth are well characterized, fibril nucleation is poorly understood. Here, we use a computational-experimental approach to resolve fibril nucleation. We show that monomer hairpin content quantified from molecular dynamics simulations is predictive of experimental fibril formation kinetics across a tau motif mutant library. Hairpin trimers are predicted to be fibril transition states; one hairpin spontaneously converts into the cross-beta conformation, templating subsequent fibril growth. We designed a disulfide-linked dimer mimicking the transition state that catalyzes fibril formation, measured by ThT fluorescence and TEM, of wild-type motif - which does not normally fibrillize. A dimer compatible with extended conformations but not the transition-state fails to nucleate fibril at any concentration. Tau repeat domain simulations show how long-range interactions sequester this motif in a mutation-dependent manner. This work implies that different fibril morphologies could arise from disease-dependent hairpin seeding from different loci."
33,Pan-cancer analyses suggest kindlin-associated global mechanochemical alterations,"Kindlins serve as mechanosensitive adapters, transducing extracellular mechanical cues to intracellular biochemical signals and thus, their perturbations potentially lead to cancer progressions. Despite the kindlin involvement in tumor development, understanding their genetic and mechanochemical characteristics across different cancers remains elusive. Here, we thoroughly examined genetic alterations in kindlins across more than 10,000 patients with 33 cancer types. Our findings reveal cancer-specific alterations, particularly prevalent in advanced tumor stage and during metastatic onset. We observed a significant co-alteration between kindlins and mechanochemical proteome in various tumors through the activation of cancer-related pathways and adverse survival outcomes. Leveraging normal mode analysis, we predicted structural consequences of cancer-specific kindlin mutations, highlighting potential impacts on stability and downstream signaling pathways. Our study unraveled alterations in epithelial–mesenchymal transition markers associated with kindlin activity. This comprehensive analysis provides a resource for guiding future mechanistic investigations and therapeutic strategies targeting the roles of kindlins in cancer treatment."
34,Mapping cell-to-tissue graphs across human placenta histology whole slide images using deep learning with HAPPY,"Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta’s heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the ‘Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY’ (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY’s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature."
35,SpiDe-Sr: blind super-resolution network for precise cell segmentation and clustering in spatial proteomics imaging,"Spatial proteomics elucidates cellular biochemical changes with unprecedented topological level. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a high-dimensional single-cell resolution platform for targeted spatial proteomics. However, the precision of subsequent clinical analysis is constrained by imaging noise and resolution. Here, we propose SpiDe-Sr, a super-resolution network embedded with a denoising module for IMC spatial resolution enhancement. SpiDe-Sr effectively resists noise and improves resolution by 4 times. We demonstrate SpiDe-Sr respectively with cells, mouse and human tissues, resulting 18.95%/27.27%/21.16% increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio and 15.95%/31.63%/15.52% increase in cell extraction accuracy. We further apply SpiDe-Sr to study the tumor microenvironment of a 20-patient clinical breast cancer cohort with 269,556 single cells, and discover the invasion of Gram-negative bacteria is positively correlated with carcinogenesis markers and negatively correlated with immunological markers. Additionally, SpiDe-Sr is also compatible with fluorescence microscopy imaging, suggesting SpiDe-Sr an alternative tool for microscopy image super-resolution."
36,GFI1B and LSD1 repress myeloid traits during megakaryocyte differentiation,"The transcription factor Growth Factor Independence 1B (GFI1B) recruits Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 A (LSD1/KDM1A) to stimulate gene programs relevant for megakaryocyte and platelet biology. Inherited pathogenic GFI1B variants result in thrombocytopenia and bleeding propensities with varying intensity. Whether these affect similar gene programs is unknow. Here we studied transcriptomic effects of four patient-derived GFI1B variants (GFI1B

) in MEG01 megakaryoblasts. Compared to normal GFI1B, each variant affected different gene programs with GFI1B
Q287*

Q287*
 versus normal conditions. Inhibiting the GFI1B-LSD1 interaction with small molecule GSK-LSD1 resulted in activation of myeloid genes in normal iPSC-derived megakaryocytes similar to what was observed for GFI1B
Q287*
 iPSC-derived megakaryocytes. Thus, GFI1B and LSD1 facilitate gene programs relevant for megakaryopoiesis while simultaneously repressing programs that induce myeloid differentiation."
37,A semi-automatic method for extracting mitochondrial cristae characteristics from 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy data,"Mitochondria are the main suppliers of energy for cells and their bioenergetic function is regulated by 
mitochondrial dynamics
: the constant changes in mitochondria size, shape, and cristae morphology to secure cell homeostasis. Although changes in mitochondrial function are implicated in a wide range of diseases, our understanding is challenged by a lack of reliable ways to extract spatial features from the cristae, the detailed visualization of which requires electron microscopy (EM). Here, we present a semi-automatic method for the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and shape analysis of mitochondria, cristae, and intracristal spaces based on 2D EM images of the murine hippocampus. We show that our method provides a more accurate characterization of mitochondrial ultrastructure in 3D than common 2D approaches and propose an operational index of mitochondria’s internal organization. With an improved consistency of 3D shape analysis and a decrease in the workload needed for large-scale analysis, we speculate that this tool will help increase our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in health and disease."
38,Uncovering structural themes across cilia microtubule inner proteins with implications for human cilia function,"Centrosomes and cilia are microtubule-based superstructures vital for cell division, signaling, and motility. The once thought hollow lumen of their microtubule core structures was recently found to hold a rich meshwork of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs). To address the outstanding question of how distinct MIPs evolved to recognize microtubule inner surfaces, we applied computational sequence analyses, structure predictions, and experimental validation to uncover evolutionarily conserved microtubule- and MIP-binding modules named NWE, SNYG, and ELLEn, and PYG and GFG-repeat by their signature motifs. These modules intermix with MT-binding DM10-modules and Mn-repeats in 24 
Chlamydomonas
 and 33 human proteins. The modules molecular characteristics provided keys to identify elusive cross-species homologs, hitherto unknown human MIP candidates, and functional properties for seven protein subfamilies, including the microtubule seam-binding NWE and ELLEn families. Our work defines structural innovations that underpin centriole and axoneme assembly and demonstrates that MIPs co-evolved with centrosomes and cilia."
39,High-throughput prediction of protein conformational distributions with subsampled AlphaFold2,"This paper presents an innovative approach for predicting the relative populations of protein conformations using AlphaFold 2, an AI-powered method that has revolutionized biology by enabling the accurate prediction of protein structures. While AlphaFold 2 has shown exceptional accuracy and speed, it is designed to predict proteins’ ground state conformations and is limited in its ability to predict conformational landscapes. Here, we demonstrate how AlphaFold 2 can directly predict the relative populations of different protein conformations by subsampling multiple sequence alignments. We tested our method against nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on two proteins with drastically different amounts of available sequence data, Abl1 kinase and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and predicted changes in their relative state populations with more than 80% accuracy. Our subsampling approach worked best when used to qualitatively predict the effects of mutations or evolution on the conformational landscape and well-populated states of proteins. It thus offers a fast and cost-effective way to predict the relative populations of protein conformations at even single-point mutation resolution, making it a useful tool for pharmacology, analysis of experimental results, and predicting evolution."
40,3D molecular generative framework for interaction-guided drug design,"Deep generative modeling has a strong potential to accelerate drug design. However, existing generative models often face challenges in generalization due to limited data, leading to less innovative designs with often unfavorable interactions for unseen target proteins. To address these issues, we propose an interaction-aware 3D molecular generative framework that enables interaction-guided drug design inside target binding pockets. By leveraging universal patterns of protein-ligand interactions as prior knowledge, our model can achieve high generalizability with limited experimental data. Its performance has been comprehensively assessed by analyzing generated ligands for unseen targets in terms of binding pose stability, affinity, geometric patterns, diversity, and novelty. Moreover, the effective design of potential mutant-selective inhibitors demonstrates the applicability of our approach to structure-based drug design."
41,The multimodality cell segmentation challenge: toward universal solutions,"Cell segmentation is a critical step for quantitative single-cell analysis in microscopy images. Existing cell segmentation methods are often tailored to specific modalities or require manual interventions to specify hyper-parameters in different experimental settings. Here, we present a multimodality cell segmentation benchmark, comprising more than 1,500 labeled images derived from more than 50 diverse biological experiments. The top participants developed a Transformer-based deep-learning algorithm that not only exceeds existing methods but can also be applied to diverse microscopy images across imaging platforms and tissue types without manual parameter adjustments. This benchmark and the improved algorithm offer promising avenues for more accurate and versatile cell analysis in microscopy imaging."
42,A dual diffusion model enables 3D molecule generation and lead optimization based on target pockets,"Structure-based generative chemistry is essential in computer-aided drug discovery by exploring a vast chemical space to design ligands with high binding affinity for targets. However, traditional in silico methods are limited by computational inefficiency, while machine learning approaches face bottlenecks due to auto-regressive sampling. To address these concerns, we have developed a conditional deep generative model, PMDM, for 3D molecule generation fitting specified targets. PMDM consists of a conditional equivariant diffusion model with both local and global molecular dynamics, enabling PMDM to consider the conditioned protein information to generate molecules efficiently. The comprehensive experiments indicate that PMDM outperforms baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics. To evaluate the applications of PMDM under real drug design scenarios, we conduct lead compound optimization for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M
pro
) and Cyclin-dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2), respectively. The selected lead optimization molecules are synthesized and evaluated for their in-vitro activities against CDK2, displaying improved CDK2 activity."
43,Precise prediction of phase-separation key residues by machine learning,"Understanding intracellular phase separation is crucial for deciphering transcriptional control, cell fate transitions, and disease mechanisms. However, the key residues, which impact phase separation the most for protein phase separation function have remained elusive. We develop PSPHunter, which can precisely predict these key residues based on machine learning scheme. In vivo and in vitro validations demonstrate that truncating just 6 key residues in GATA3 disrupts phase separation, enhancing tumor cell migration and inhibiting growth. Glycine and its motifs are enriched in spacer and key residues, as revealed by our comprehensive analysis. PSPHunter identifies nearly 80% of disease-associated phase-separating proteins, with frequent mutated pathological residues like glycine and proline often residing in these key residues. PSPHunter thus emerges as a crucial tool to uncover key residues, facilitating insights into phase separation mechanisms governing transcriptional control, cell fate transitions, and disease development."
44,Predicting and improving complex beer flavor through machine learning,"The perception and appreciation of food flavor depends on many interacting chemical compounds and external factors, and therefore proves challenging to understand and predict. Here, we combine extensive chemical and sensory analyses of 250 different beers to train machine learning models that allow predicting flavor and consumer appreciation. For each beer, we measure over 200 chemical properties, perform quantitative descriptive sensory analysis with a trained tasting panel and map data from over 180,000 consumer reviews to train 10 different machine learning models. The best-performing algorithm, Gradient Boosting, yields models that significantly outperform predictions based on conventional statistics and accurately predict complex food features and consumer appreciation from chemical profiles. Model dissection allows identifying specific and unexpected compounds as drivers of beer flavor and appreciation. Adding these compounds results in variants of commercial alcoholic and non-alcoholic beers with improved consumer appreciation. Together, our study reveals how big data and machine learning uncover complex links between food chemistry, flavor and consumer perception, and lays the foundation to develop novel, tailored foods with superior flavors."
45,Assessing GPT-4 for cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq analysis,"Here we demonstrate that the large language model GPT-4 can accurately annotate cell types using marker gene information in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. When evaluated across hundreds of tissue and cell types, GPT-4 generates cell type annotations exhibiting strong concordance with manual annotations. This capability can considerably reduce the effort and expertise required for cell type annotation. Additionally, we have developed an R software package GPTCelltype for GPT-4’s automated cell type annotation."
46,Diverging co-translational protein complex assembly pathways are governed by interface energy distribution,"Protein-protein interactions are at the heart of all cellular processes, with the ribosome emerging as a platform, orchestrating the nascent-chain interplay dynamics. Here, to study the characteristics governing co-translational protein folding and complex assembly, we combine selective ribosome profiling, imaging, and N-terminomics with all-atoms molecular dynamics. Focusing on conserved N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), we uncover diverging co-translational assembly pathways, where highly homologous subunits serve opposite functions. We find that only a few residues serve as “hotspots,” initiating co-translational assembly interactions upon exposure at the ribosome exit tunnel. These hotspots are characterized by high binding energy, anchoring the entire interface assembly. Alpha-helices harboring hotspots are highly thermolabile, folding and unfolding during simulations, depending on their partner subunit to avoid misfolding. In vivo hotspot mutations disrupted co-translational complexation, leading to aggregation. Accordingly, conservation analysis reveals that missense NATs variants, causing neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, disrupt putative hotspot clusters. Expanding our study to include phosphofructokinase, anthranilate synthase, and nucleoporin subcomplex, we employ AlphaFold-Multimer to model the complexes’ complete structures. Computing MD-derived interface energy profiles, we find similar trends. Here, we propose a model based on the distribution of interface energy as a strong predictor of co-translational assembly."
47,Developmental progression of DNA double-strand break repair deciphered by a single-allele resolution mutation classifier,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by a hierarchically regulated network of pathways. Factors influencing the choice of particular repair pathways, however remain poorly characterized. Here we develop an Integrated Classification Pipeline (ICP) to decompose and categorize CRISPR/Cas9 generated mutations on genomic target sites in complex multicellular insects. The ICP outputs graphic rank ordered classifications of mutant alleles to visualize discriminating DSB repair fingerprints generated from different target sites and alternative inheritance patterns of CRISPR components. We uncover highly reproducible lineage-specific mutation fingerprints in individual organisms and a developmental progression wherein Microhomology-Mediated End-Joining (MMEJ) or Insertion events predominate during early rapid mitotic cell cycles, switching to distinct subsets of Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ) alleles, and then to Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)-based gene conversion. These repair signatures enable marker-free tracking of specific mutations in dynamic populations, including NHEJ and HDR events within the same samples, for in-depth analysis of diverse gene editing events."
48,Multi-omic integration of microbiome data for identifying disease-associated modules,"Multi-omic studies of the human gut microbiome are crucial for understanding its role in disease across multiple functional layers. Nevertheless, integrating and analyzing such complex datasets poses significant challenges. Most notably, current analysis methods often yield extensive lists of disease-associated features (e.g., species, pathways, or metabolites), without capturing the multi-layered structure of the data. Here, we address this challenge by introducing “MintTea”, an intermediate integration-based approach combining canonical correlation analysis extensions, consensus analysis, and an evaluation protocol. MintTea identifies “disease-associated multi-omic modules”, comprising features from multiple omics that shift in concord and that collectively associate with the disease. Applied to diverse cohorts, MintTea captures modules with high predictive power, significant cross-omic correlations, and alignment with known microbiome-disease associations. For example, analyzing samples from a metabolic syndrome study, MintTea identifies a module with serum glutamate- and TCA cycle-related metabolites, along with bacterial species linked to insulin resistance. In another dataset, MintTea identifies a module associated with late-stage colorectal cancer, including 
Peptostreptococcus
 and 
Gemella
 species and fecal amino acids, in line with these species’ metabolic activity and their coordinated gradual increase with cancer development. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced integration methods in generating systems-level, multifaceted hypotheses underlying microbiome-disease interactions."
49,The genetic architecture of multimodal human brain age,"The complex biological mechanisms underlying human brain aging remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the genetic architecture of three brain age gaps (BAG) derived from gray matter volume (GM-BAG), white matter microstructure (WM-BAG), and functional connectivity (FC-BAG). We identified sixteen genomic loci that reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5×10
−8
). A gene-drug-disease network highlighted genes linked to GM-BAG for treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders and WM-BAG genes for cancer therapy. GM-BAG displayed the most pronounced heritability enrichment in genetic variants within conserved regions. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, but not neurons, exhibited notable heritability enrichment in WM and FC-BAG, respectively. Mendelian randomization identified potential causal effects of several chronic diseases on brain aging, such as type 2 diabetes on GM-BAG and AD on WM-BAG. Our results provide insights into the genetics of human brain aging, with clinical implications for potential lifestyle and therapeutic interventions. All results are publicly available at

50,"Characterisation of 
Plasmodium vivax
 lactate dehydrogenase dynamics in 
P. vivax
 infections","Plasmodium vivax
 lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH) is an essential enzyme in the glycolytic pathway of 
P. vivax
. It is widely used as a diagnostic biomarker and a measure of total-body parasite biomass in vivax malaria. However, the dynamics of PvLDH remains poorly understood. Here, we developed mathematical models that capture parasite and matrix PvLDH dynamics in ex vivo culture and the human host. We estimated key biological parameters characterising in vivo PvLDH dynamics based on longitudinal data of parasitemia and PvLDH concentration collected from 
P. vivax
-infected humans, with the estimates informed by the ex vivo data as prior knowledge in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. We found that the in vivo accumulation rate of intraerythrocytic PvLDH peaks at 10–20 h post-invasion (late ring stage) with a median estimate of intraerythrocytic PvLDH mass at the end of the life cycle to be 9.4 × 10
−3
ng. We also found that the median estimate of in vivo PvLDH half-life was approximately 21.9 h. Our findings provide a foundation with which to advance our quantitative understanding of 
P. vivax
 biology and will facilitate the improvement of PvLDH-based diagnostic tools."
51,InPACT: a computational method for accurate characterization of intronic polyadenylation from RNA sequencing data,"Alternative polyadenylation can occur in introns, termed intronic polyadenylation (IPA), has been implicated in diverse biological processes and diseases, as it can produce noncoding transcripts or transcripts with truncated coding regions. However, a reliable method is required to accurately characterize IPA. Here, we propose a computational method called InPACT, which allows for the precise characterization of IPA from conventional RNA-seq data. InPACT successfully identifies numerous previously unannotated IPA transcripts in human cells, many of which are translated, as evidenced by ribosome profiling data. We have demonstrated that InPACT outperforms other methods in terms of IPA identification and quantification. Moreover, InPACT applied to monocyte activation reveals temporally coordinated IPA events. Further application on single-cell RNA-seq data of human fetal bone marrow reveals the expression of several IPA isoforms in a context-specific manner. Therefore, InPACT represents a powerful tool for the accurate characterization of IPA from RNA-seq data."
52,Predicting nuclear G-quadruplex RNA-binding proteins with roles in transcription and phase separation,"RNA-binding proteins are central for many biological processes and their characterization has demonstrated a broad range of functions as well as a wide spectrum of target structures. RNA G-quadruplexes are important regulatory elements occurring in both coding and non-coding transcripts, yet our knowledge of their structure-based interactions is at present limited. Here, using theoretical predictions and experimental approaches, we show that many chromatin-binding proteins bind to RNA G-quadruplexes, and we classify them based on their RNA G-quadruplex-binding potential. Combining experimental identification of nuclear RNA G-quadruplex-binding proteins with computational approaches, we build a prediction tool that assigns probability score for a nuclear protein to bind RNA G-quadruplexes. We show that predicted G-quadruplex RNA-binding proteins exhibit a high degree of protein disorder and hydrophilicity and suggest involvement in both transcription and phase-separation into membrane-less organelles. Finally, we present the G4-Folded/UNfolded Nuclear Interaction Explorer System (G4-FUNNIES) for estimating RNA G4-binding propensities at

53,Endothelial gene regulatory elements associated with cardiopharyngeal lineage differentiation,"Endothelial cells (EC) differentiate from multiple sources, including the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, which gives rise also to cardiac and branchiomeric muscles. The enhancers activated during endothelial differentiation within the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm are not completely known. Here, we use a cardiogenic mesoderm differentiation model that activates an endothelial transcription program to identify endothelial regulatory elements activated in early cardiogenic mesoderm. Integrating chromatin remodeling and gene expression data with available single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse embryos, we identify 101 putative regulatory elements of EC genes. We then apply a machine-learning strategy, trained on validated enhancers, to predict enhancers. Using this computational assay, we determine that 50% of these sequences are likely enhancers, some of which are already reported. We also identify a smaller set of regulatory elements of well-known EC genes and validate them using genetic and epigenetic perturbation. Finally, we integrate multiple data sources and computational tools to search for transcriptional factor binding motifs. In conclusion, we show EC regulatory sequences with a high likelihood to be enhancers, and we validate a subset of them using computational and cell culture models. Motif analyses show that the core EC transcription factors GATA/ETS/FOS is a likely driver of EC regulation in cardiopharyngeal mesoderm."
54,SQANTI3: curation of long-read transcriptomes for accurate identification of known and novel isoforms,"SQANTI3 is a tool designed for the quality control, curation and annotation of long-read transcript models obtained with third-generation sequencing technologies. Leveraging its annotation framework, SQANTI3 calculates quality descriptors of transcript models, junctions and transcript ends. With this information, potential artifacts can be identified and replaced with reliable sequences. Furthermore, the integrated functional annotation feature enables subsequent functional iso-transcriptomics analyses."
55,SpatialData: an open and universal data framework for spatial omics,"Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding of biological tissues. However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated in the context of multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multimodal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study."
56,Allele-specific transcriptional effects of subclonal copy number alterations enable genotype-phenotype mapping in cancer cells,"Subclonal copy number alterations are a prevalent feature in tumors with high chromosomal instability and result in heterogeneous cancer cell populations with distinct phenotypes. However, the extent to which subclonal copy number alterations contribute to clone-specific phenotypes remains poorly understood. We develop TreeAlign, which computationally integrates independently sampled single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing data from the same cell population. TreeAlign accurately encodes dosage effects from subclonal copy number alterations, the impact of allelic imbalance on allele-specific transcription, and obviates the need to define genotypic clones from a phylogeny a priori, leading to highly granular definitions of clones with distinct expression programs. These improvements enable clone-clone gene expression comparisons with higher resolution and identification of expression programs that are genomically independent. Our approach sets the stage for dissecting the relative contribution of fixed genomic alterations and dynamic epigenetic processes on gene expression programs in cancer."
57,"Strong positive selection biases identity-by-descent-based inferences of recent demography and population structure in 
Plasmodium falciparum","Malaria genomic surveillance often estimates parasite genetic relatedness using metrics such as Identity-By-Decent (IBD), yet strong positive selection stemming from antimalarial drug resistance or other interventions may bias IBD-based estimates. In this study, we use simulations, a true IBD inference algorithm, and empirical data sets from different malaria transmission settings to investigate the extent of this bias and explore potential correction strategies. We analyze whole genome sequence data generated from 640 new and 3089 publicly available 
Plasmodium falciparum
 clinical isolates. We demonstrate that positive selection distorts IBD distributions, leading to underestimated effective population size and blurred population structure. Additionally, we discover that the removal of IBD peak regions partially restores the accuracy of IBD-based inferences, with this effect contingent on the population’s background genetic relatedness and extent of inbreeding. Consequently, we advocate for selection correction for parasite populations undergoing strong, recent positive selection, particularly in high malaria transmission settings."
58,"Balancing competing effects of tissue growth and cytoskeletal regulation during 
Drosophila
 wing disc development","How a developing organ robustly coordinates the cellular mechanics and growth to reach a final size and shape remains poorly understood. Through iterations between experiments and model simulations that include a mechanistic description of interkinetic nuclear migration, we show that the local curvature, height, and nuclear positioning of cells in the 
Drosophila
 wing imaginal disc are defined by the concurrent patterning of actomyosin contractility, cell-ECM adhesion, ECM stiffness, and interfacial membrane tension. We show that increasing cell proliferation via different growth-promoting pathways results in two distinct phenotypes. Triggering proliferation through insulin signaling increases basal curvature, but an increase in growth through Dpp signaling and Myc causes tissue flattening. These distinct phenotypic outcomes arise from differences in how each growth pathway regulates the cellular cytoskeleton, including contractility and cell-ECM adhesion. The coupled regulation of proliferation and cytoskeletal regulators is a general strategy to meet the multiple context-dependent criteria defining tissue morphogenesis."
59,scPROTEIN: a versatile deep graph contrastive learning framework for single-cell proteomics embedding,"Single-cell proteomics sequencing technology sheds light on protein–protein interactions, posttranslational modifications and proteoform dynamics in the cell. However, the uncertainty estimation for peptide quantification, data missingness, batch effects and high noise hinder the analysis of single-cell proteomic data. It is important to solve this set of tangled problems together, but the existing methods tailored for single-cell transcriptomes cannot fully address this task. Here we propose a versatile framework designed for single-cell proteomics data analysis called scPROTEIN, which consists of peptide uncertainty estimation based on a multitask heteroscedastic regression model and cell embedding generation based on graph contrastive learning. scPROTEIN can estimate the uncertainty of peptide quantification, denoise protein data, remove batch effects and encode single-cell proteomic-specific embeddings in a unified framework. We demonstrate that scPROTEIN is efficient for cell clustering, batch correction, cell type annotation, clinical analysis and spatially resolved proteomic data exploration."
60,Tradeoffs in alignment and assembly-based methods for structural variant detection with long-read sequencing data,"Long-read sequencing offers long contiguous DNA fragments, facilitating diploid genome assembly and structural variant (SV) detection. Efficient and robust algorithms for SV identification are crucial with increasing data availability. Alignment-based methods, favored for their computational efficiency and lower coverage requirements, are prominent. Alternative approaches, relying solely on available reads for de novo genome assembly and employing assembly-based tools for SV detection via comparison to a reference genome, demand significantly more computational resources. However, the lack of comprehensive benchmarking constrains our comprehension and hampers further algorithm development. Here we systematically compare 14 read alignment-based SV calling methods (including 4 deep learning-based methods and 1 hybrid method), and 4 assembly-based SV calling methods, alongside 4 upstream aligners and 7 assemblers. Assembly-based tools excel in detecting large SVs, especially insertions, and exhibit robustness to evaluation parameter changes and coverage fluctuations. Conversely, alignment-based tools demonstrate superior genotyping accuracy at low sequencing coverage (5-10×) and excel in detecting complex SVs, like translocations, inversions, and duplications. Our evaluation provides performance insights, highlighting the absence of a universally superior tool. We furnish guidelines across 31 criteria combinations, aiding users in selecting the most suitable tools for diverse scenarios and offering directions for further method development."
61,Prediction of glycopeptide fragment mass spectra by deep learning,"Deep learning has achieved a notable success in mass spectrometry-based proteomics and is now emerging in glycoproteomics. While various deep learning models can predict fragment mass spectra of peptides with good accuracy, they cannot cope with the non-linear glycan structure in an intact glycopeptide. Herein, we present DeepGlyco, a deep learning-based approach for the prediction of fragment spectra of intact glycopeptides. Our model adopts tree-structured long-short term memory networks to process the glycan moiety and a graph neural network architecture to incorporate potential fragmentation pathways of a specific glycan structure. This feature is beneficial to model explainability and differentiation ability of glycan structural isomers. We further demonstrate that predicted spectral libraries can be used for data-independent acquisition glycoproteomics as a supplement for library completeness. We expect that this work will provide a valuable deep learning resource for glycoproteomics."
62,The bone ecosystem facilitates multiple myeloma relapse and the evolution of heterogeneous drug resistant disease,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an osteolytic malignancy that is incurable due to the emergence of treatment resistant disease. Defining how, when and where myeloma cell intrinsic and extrinsic bone microenvironmental mechanisms cause relapse is challenging with current biological approaches. Here, we report a biology-driven spatiotemporal hybrid agent-based model of the MM-bone microenvironment. Results indicate MM intrinsic mechanisms drive the evolution of treatment resistant disease but that the protective effects of bone microenvironment mediated drug resistance (EMDR) significantly enhances the probability and heterogeneity of resistant clones arising under treatment. Further, the model predicts that targeting of EMDR deepens therapy response by eliminating sensitive clones proximal to stroma and bone, a finding supported by in vivo studies. Altogether, our model allows for the study of MM clonal evolution over time in the bone microenvironment and will be beneficial for optimizing treatment efficacy so as to significantly delay disease relapse."
63,Accurate and rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing using a machine learning-assisted nanomotion technology platform,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, reducing treatment options for infected patients. AMR is promoted by a lack of access to rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs). Accelerated ASTs can identify effective antibiotics for treatment in a timely and informed manner. We describe a rapid growth-independent phenotypic AST that uses a nanomotion technology platform to measure bacterial vibrations. Machine learning techniques are applied to analyze a large dataset encompassing 2762 individual nanomotion recordings from 1180 spiked positive blood culture samples covering 364 
Escherichia coli
 and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae
 isolates exposed to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. The training performances of the different classification models achieve between 90.5 and 100% accuracy. Independent testing of the AST on 223 strains, including in clinical setting, correctly predict susceptibility and resistance with accuracies between 89.5% and 98.9%. The study shows the potential of this nanomotion platform for future bacterial phenotype delineation."
64,Data-driven prediction of colonization outcomes for complex microbial communities,"Microbial interactions can lead to different colonization outcomes of exogenous species, be they pathogenic or beneficial in nature. Predicting the colonization of exogenous species in complex communities remains a fundamental challenge in microbial ecology, mainly due to our limited knowledge of the diverse mechanisms governing microbial dynamics. Here, we propose a data-driven approach independent of any dynamics model to predict colonization outcomes of exogenous species from the baseline compositions of microbial communities. We systematically validate this approach using synthetic data, finding that machine learning models can predict not only the binary colonization outcome but also the post-invasion steady-state abundance of the invading species. Then we conduct colonization experiments for commensal gut bacteria species 
Enterococcus faecium
 and 
Akkermansia muciniphila
 in hundreds of human stool-derived in vitro microbial communities, confirming that the data-driven approaches can predict the colonization outcomes in experiments. Furthermore, we find that while most resident species are predicted to have a weak negative impact on the colonization of exogenous species, strongly interacting species could significantly alter the colonization outcomes, e.g., 
Enterococcus faecalis
 inhibits the invasion of 
E. faecium
 invasion. The presented results suggest that the data-driven approaches are powerful tools to inform the ecology and management of microbial communities."
65,Benchmarking spatial clustering methods with spatially resolved transcriptomics data,"Spatial clustering, which shares an analogy with single-cell clustering, has expanded the scope of tissue physiology studies from cell-centroid to structure-centroid with spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. Computational methods have undergone remarkable development in recent years, but a comprehensive benchmark study is still lacking. Here we present a benchmark study of 13 computational methods on 34 SRT data (7 datasets). The performance was evaluated on the basis of accuracy, spatial continuity, marker genes detection, scalability, and robustness. We found existing methods were complementary in terms of their performance and functionality, and we provide guidance for selecting appropriate methods for given scenarios. On testing additional 22 challenging datasets, we identified challenges in identifying noncontinuous spatial domains and limitations of existing methods, highlighting their inadequacies in handling recent large-scale tasks. Furthermore, with 145 simulated data, we examined the robustness of these methods against four different factors, and assessed the impact of pre- and postprocessing approaches. Our study offers a comprehensive evaluation of existing spatial clustering methods with SRT data, paving the way for future advancements in this rapidly evolving field."
66,Local prediction-learning in high-dimensional spaces enables neural networks to plan,"Planning and problem solving are cornerstones of higher brain function. But we do not know how the brain does that. We show that learning of a suitable cognitive map of the problem space suffices. Furthermore, this can be reduced to learning to predict the next observation through local synaptic plasticity. Importantly, the resulting cognitive map encodes relations between actions and observations, and its emergent high-dimensional geometry provides a sense of direction for reaching distant goals. This quasi-Euclidean sense of direction provides a simple heuristic for online planning that works almost as well as the best offline planning algorithms from AI. If the problem space is a physical space, this method automatically extracts structural regularities from the sequence of observations that it receives so that it can generalize to unseen parts. This speeds up learning of navigation in 2D mazes and the locomotion with complex actuator systems, such as legged bodies. The cognitive map learner that we propose does not require a teacher, similar to self-attention networks (Transformers). But in contrast to Transformers, it does not require backpropagation of errors or very large datasets for learning. Hence it provides a blue-print for future energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware that acquires advanced cognitive capabilities through autonomous on-chip learning."
67,A neural network-based model framework for cell-fate decisions and development,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) fulfill the essential function of maintaining the stability of cellular differentiation states by sustaining lineage-specific gene expression, while driving the progression of development. However, accounting for the relative stability of intermediate differentiation stages and their divergent trajectories remains a major challenge for models of developmental biology. Here, we develop an empirical data-based associative GRN model (AGRN) in which regulatory networks store multilineage stage-specific gene expression profiles as associative memory patterns. These networks are capable of responding to multiple instructive signals and, depending on signal timing and identity, can dynamically drive the differentiation of multipotent cells toward different cell state attractors. The AGRN dynamics can thus generate diverse lineage-committed cell populations in a robust yet flexible manner, providing an attractor-based explanation for signal-driven cell fate decisions during differentiation and offering a readily generalizable modelling tool that can be applied to a wide variety of cell specification systems."
68,Label-aware distance mitigates temporal and spatial variability for clustering and visualization of single-cell gene expression data,"Clustering and visualization are essential parts of single-cell gene expression data analysis. The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. The batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Label-Aware Distance (
Lad
), a metric using temporal/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate 
Lad
 on simulated data as well as apply it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
Lad
 provides better cell embedding than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets. It can be used in distance-based clustering and visualization methods to combine the power of multiple samples to help make biological findings."
69,The landscape of immune checkpoint-related long non-coding RNAs core regulatory circuitry reveals implications for immunoregulation and immunotherapy responses,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could modulate expression of immune checkpoints (ICPs) by cooperating with immunity genes in tumor immunization. However, precise functions in immunity and potential for predicting ICP inhibitors (ICI) response have been described for only a few lncRNAs. Here we present an integrated framework that leverages network-based analyses and Bayesian network inference to identify the regulated relationships including lncRNA, ICP and immunity genes as ICP-related LncRNAs mediated Core Regulatory Circuitry Triplets (ICP-LncCRCTs) that can make robust predictions. Hub ICP-related lncRNAs such as MIR155HG and ADAMTS9-AS2 were highlighted to play central roles in immune regulation. Specific ICP-related lncRNAs could distinguish cancer subtypes. Moreover, the ICP-related lncRNAs are likely to significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, MHC, CYT. Some ICP-LncCRCTs such as CXCL10-MIR155HG-ICOS could better predict one-, three- and five-year prognosis compared to single molecule in melanoma. We also validated that some ICP-LncCRCTs could effectively predict ICI-response using three kinds of machine learning algorithms follow five independent datasets. Specially, combining ICP-LncCRCTs with the tumor mutation burden (TMB) improves the prediction of ICI-treated melanoma patients. Altogether, this study will improve our grasp of lncRNA functions and accelerating discovery of lncRNA-based biomarkers in ICI treatment."
70,Classification of likely functional class for ligand binding sites identified from fragment screening,"Fragment screening is used to identify binding sites and leads in drug discovery, but it is often unclear which binding sites are functionally important. Here, data from 37 experiments, and 1309 protein structures binding to 1601 ligands were analysed. A method to group ligands by binding sites is introduced and sites clustered according to profiles of relative solvent accessibility. This identified 293 unique ligand binding sites, grouped into four clusters (C1-4). C1 includes larger, buried, conserved, and population missense-depleted sites, enriched in known functional sites. C4 comprises smaller, accessible, divergent, missense-enriched sites, depleted in functional sites. A site in C1 is 28 times more likely to be functional than one in C4. Seventeen sites, which to the best of our knowledge are novel, in 13 proteins are identified as likely to be functionally important with examples from human tenascin and 5-aminolevulinate synthase highlighted. A multi-layer perceptron, and 
K
-nearest neighbours model are presented to predict cluster labels for ligand binding sites with an accuracy of 96% and 100%, respectively, so allowing functional classification of sites for proteins not in this set. Our findings will be of interest to those studying protein-ligand interactions and developing new drugs or function modulators."
71,OrgaSegment: deep-learning based organoid segmentation to quantify CFTR dependent fluid secretion,"Epithelial ion and fluid transport studies in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are increasingly being used for preclinical studies, drug development and precision medicine applications. Epithelial fluid transport properties in PDOs can be measured through visual changes in organoid (lumen) size. Such organoid phenotypes have been highly instrumental for the studying of diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), which is characterized by genetic mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel. Here we present OrgaSegment, a MASK-RCNN based deep-learning segmentation model allowing for the segmentation of individual intestinal PDO structures from bright-field images. OrgaSegment recognizes spherical structures in addition to the oddly-shaped organoids that are a hallmark of CF organoids and can be used in organoid swelling assays, including the new drug-induced swelling assay that we show here. OrgaSegment enabled easy quantification of organoid swelling and could discriminate between organoids with different CFTR mutations, as well as measure responses to CFTR modulating drugs. The easy-to-apply label-free segmentation tool can help to study CFTR-based fluid secretion and possibly other epithelial ion transport mechanisms in organoids."
72,Charting cellular differentiation trajectories with Ricci flow,"Complex biological processes, such as cellular differentiation, require intricate rewiring of intra-cellular signalling networks. Previous characterisations revealed a raised network entropy underlies less differentiated and malignant cell states. A connection between entropy and Ricci curvature led to applications of discrete curvatures to biological networks. However, predicting dynamic biological network rewiring remains an open problem. Here we apply Ricci curvature and Ricci flow to biological network rewiring. By investigating the relationship between network entropy and Forman-Ricci curvature, theoretically and empirically on single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that the two measures do not always positively correlate, as previously suggested, and provide complementary rather than interchangeable information. We next employ Ricci flow to derive network rewiring trajectories from stem cells to differentiated cells, accurately predicting true intermediate time points in gene expression time courses. In summary, we present a differential geometry toolkit for understanding dynamic network rewiring during cellular differentiation and cancer."
73,The decline of the 2022 Italian mpox epidemic: Role of behavior changes and control strategies,"In 2022, a global outbreak of mpox occurred, predominantly impacting men who have sex with men (MSM). The rapid decline of this epidemic is yet to be fully understood. We investigated the Italian outbreak by means of an individual-based mathematical model calibrated to surveillance data. The model accounts for transmission within the MSM sexual contact network, in recreational and sex clubs attended by MSM, and in households. We indicate a strong spontaneous reduction in sexual transmission (61-87%) in affected MSM communities as the possible driving factor for the rapid decline in cases. The MSM sexual contact network was the main responsible for transmission (about 80%), with clubs and households contributing residually. Contact tracing prevented about half of the potential cases, and a higher success rate in tracing contacts could significantly amplify its effectiveness. Notably, immunizing the 23% of MSM with the highest sexual activity (10 or more partners per year) could completely prevent new mpox resurgences. This research underscores the importance of augmenting contact tracing, targeted immunization campaigns of high-risk groups, and fostering reactive behavioral changes as key strategies to manage and prevent the spread of emerging sexually transmitted pathogens like mpox within the MSM community."
74,Structure-based prediction and characterization of photo-crosslinking in native protein–RNA complexes,"UV-crosslinking of protein and RNA in direct contacts has been widely used to study protein-RNA complexes while our understanding of the photo-crosslinking mechanisms remains poor. This knowledge gap is due to the challenge of precisely mapping the crosslink sites in protein and RNA simultaneously in their native sequence and structural contexts. Here we systematically analyze protein-RNA interactions and photo-crosslinking by bridging crosslinked nucleotides and amino acids mapped using different assays with protein-RNA complex structures. We developed a computational method PxR3D-map which reliably predicts crosslink sites using structural information characterizing protein-RNA interaction interfaces. Analysis of the informative features revealed that photo-crosslinking is facilitated by base stacking with not only aromatic residues, but also dipeptide bonds that involve glycine, and distinct mechanisms are utilized by different RNA-binding domains. Our work suggests protein-RNA photo-crosslinking is highly selective in the cellular environment, which can guide data interpretation and further technology development for UV-crosslinking-based assays."
75,Cell type signatures in cell-free DNA fragmentation profiles reveal disease biology,"Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments have characteristics that are specific to the cell types that release them. Current methods for cfDNA deconvolution typically use disease tailored marker selection in a limited number of bulk tissues or cell lines. Here, we utilize single cell transcriptome data as a comprehensive cellular reference set for disease-agnostic cfDNA cell-of-origin analysis. We correlate cfDNA-inferred nucleosome spacing with gene expression to rank the relative contribution of over 490 cell types to plasma cfDNA. In 744 healthy individuals and patients, we uncover cell type signatures in support of emerging disease paradigms in oncology and prenatal care. We train predictive models that can differentiate patients with colorectal cancer (84.7%), early-stage breast cancer (90.1%), multiple myeloma (AUC 95.0%), and preeclampsia (88.3%) from matched controls. Importantly, our approach performs well in ultra-low coverage cfDNA datasets and can be readily transferred to diverse clinical settings for the expansion of liquid biopsy."
76,Systematic review and meta-analysis for a Global Patient co-Owned Cloud (GPOC),"Cloud-based personal health records increase globally. The GPOC series introduces the concept of a Global Patient co-Owned Cloud (GPOC) of personal health records. Here, we present the GPOC series’ Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) registered and Preferred Reporting Items Systematic and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic review and meta-analysis. It examines cloud-based personal health records and factors such as data security, efficiency, privacy and cost-based measures. It is a meta-analysis of twelve relevant axes encompassing performance, cryptography and parameters based on efficiency (runtimes, key generation times), security (access policies, encryption, decryption) and cost (gas). This aims to generate a basis for further research, a GPOC sandbox model, and a possible construction of a global platform. This area lacks standard and shows marked heterogeneity. A consensus within this field would be beneficial to the development of a GPOC. A GPOC could spark the development and global dissemination of artificial intelligence in healthcare."
77,BASALT refines binning from metagenomic data and increases resolution of genome-resolved metagenomic analysis,"Metagenomic binning is an essential technique for genome-resolved characterization of uncultured microorganisms in various ecosystems but hampered by the low efficiency of binning tools in adequately recovering metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Here, we introduce BASALT (

BASALT employs multiple binners with multiple thresholds to produce initial bins, then utilizes neural networks to identify core sequences to remove redundant bins and refine non-redundant bins. Using the same assemblies generated from Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) datasets, BASALT produces up to twice as many MAGs as VAMB, DASTool, or metaWRAP. Processing assemblies from a lake sediment dataset, BASALT produces ~30% more MAGs than metaWRAP, including 21 unique class-level prokaryotic lineages. Functional annotations reveal that BASALT can retrieve 47.6% more non-redundant opening-reading frames than metaWRAP. These results highlight the robust handling of metagenomic sequencing data of BASALT."
78,Enabling large-scale screening of Barrett’s esophagus using weakly supervised deep learning in histopathology,"Timely detection of Barrett’s esophagus, the pre-malignant condition of esophageal adenocarcinoma, can improve patient survival rates. The Cytosponge-TFF3 test, a non-endoscopic minimally invasive procedure, has been used for diagnosing intestinal metaplasia in Barrett’s. However, it depends on pathologist’s assessment of two slides stained with H&E and the immunohistochemical biomarker TFF3. This resource-intensive clinical workflow limits large-scale screening in the at-risk population. To improve screening capacity, we propose a deep learning approach for detecting Barrett’s from routinely stained H&E slides. The approach solely relies on diagnostic labels, eliminating the need for expensive localized expert annotations. We train and independently validate our approach on two clinical trial datasets, totaling 1866 patients. We achieve 91.4% and 87.3% AUROCs on discovery and external test datasets for the H&E model, comparable to the TFF3 model. Our proposed semi-automated clinical workflow can reduce pathologists’ workload to 48% without sacrificing diagnostic performance, enabling pathologists to prioritize high risk cases."
79,Accurate prediction of RNA secondary structure including pseudoknots through solving minimum-cost flow with learned potentials,"Pseudoknots are key structure motifs of RNA and pseudoknotted RNAs play important roles in a variety of biological processes. Here, we present KnotFold, an accurate approach to the prediction of RNA secondary structure including pseudoknots. The key elements of KnotFold include a learned potential function and a minimum-cost flow algorithm to find the secondary structure with the lowest potential. KnotFold learns the potential from the RNAs with known structures using an attention-based neural network, thus avoiding the inaccuracy of hand-crafted energy functions. The specially designed minimum-cost flow algorithm used by KnotFold considers all possible combinations of base pairs and selects from them the optimal combination. The algorithm breaks the restriction of nested base pairs required by the widely used dynamic programming algorithms, thus enabling the identification of pseudoknots. Using 1,009 pseudoknotted RNAs as representatives, we demonstrate the successful application of KnotFold in predicting RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots with accuracy higher than the state-of-the-art approaches. We anticipate that KnotFold, with its superior accuracy, will greatly facilitate the understanding of RNA structures and functionalities."
80,AlphaPept: a modern and open framework for MS-based proteomics,"In common with other omics technologies, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics produces ever-increasing amounts of raw data, making efficient analysis a principal challenge. A plethora of different computational tools can process the MS data to derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. However, during the last years there has been dramatic progress in computer science, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we develop AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Numba for just-in-time compilation on CPU and GPU achieves hundred-fold speed improvements. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while accessing the latest advances. We provide an easy on-ramp for community contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than acquisition. AlphaPept can be used to build automated processing pipelines with web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. It provides easy access via one-click installation, a modular Python library for advanced users, and via an open GitHub repository for developers."
81,Crosstalk of cell death pathways unveils an autophagy-related gene AOC3 as a critical prognostic marker in colorectal cancer,"The intricate crosstalk of various cell death forms was recently implicated in cancers, laying a foundation for exploring the association between cell death and cancers. Recent evidence has demonstrated that biological networks outperform snapshot gene expression profiles at discovering promising biomarkers or heterogenous molecular subtypes across different cancer types. In order to investigate the behavioral patterns of cell death-related interaction perturbation in colorectal cancer (CRC), this study constructed the interaction-perturbation network with 11 cell death pathways and delineated four cell death network (CDN) derived heterogeneous subtypes (CDN1-4) with distinct molecular characteristics and clinical outcomes. Specifically, we identified a subtype (CDN4) endowed with high autophagy activity and the worst prognosis. Furthermore, 
AOC3
 was identified as a potential autophagy-related biomarker, which demonstrated exceptional predictive performance for CDN4 and significant prognostic value. Overall, this study sheds light on the complex interplay of various cell death forms and reveals an autophagy-related gene 
AOC3
 as a critical prognostic marker in CRC."
82,Drivers and impact of the early silent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) circulated cryptically before being identified as a threat, delaying interventions. Here we studied the drivers of such silent spread and its epidemic impact to inform future response planning. We focused on Alpha spread out of the UK. We integrated spatio-temporal records of international mobility, local epidemic growth and genomic surveillance into a Bayesian framework to reconstruct the first three months after Alpha emergence. We found that silent circulation lasted from days to months and decreased with the logarithm of sequencing coverage. Social restrictions in some countries likely delayed the establishment of local transmission, mitigating the negative consequences of late detection. Revisiting the initial spread of Alpha supports local mitigation at the destination in case of emerging events."
83,Interrogations of single-cell RNA splicing landscapes with SCASL define new cell identities with physiological relevance,"RNA splicing shapes the gene regulatory programs that underlie various physiological and disease processes. Here, we present the SCASL (single-cell clustering based on alternative splicing landscapes) method for interrogating the heterogeneity of RNA splicing with single-cell RNA-seq data. SCASL resolves the issue of biased and sparse data coverage on single-cell RNA splicing and provides a new scheme for classifications of cell identities. With previously published datasets as examples, SCASL identifies new cell clusters indicating potentially precancerous and early-tumor stages in triple-negative breast cancer, illustrates cell lineages of embryonic liver development, and provides fine clusters of highly heterogeneous tumor-associated CD4 and CD8 T cells with functional and physiological relevance. Most of these findings are not readily available via conventional cell clustering based on single-cell gene expression data. Our study shows the potential of SCASL in revealing the intrinsic RNA splicing heterogeneity and generating biological insights into the dynamic and functional cell landscapes in complex tissues."
84,Constructing telomere-to-telomere diploid genome by polishing haploid nanopore-based assembly,"Draft genomes generated from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads are known to have a higher error rate. Although existing genome polishers can enhance their quality, the error rate (including mismatches, indels and switching errors between paternal and maternal haplotypes) can be significant. Here, we develop two polishers, hypo-short and hypo-hybrid to address this issue. Hypo-short utilizes Illumina short reads to polish an ONT-based draft assembly, resulting in a high-quality assembly with low error rates and switching errors. Expanding on this, hypo-hybrid incorporates ONT long reads to further refine the assembly into a diploid representation. Leveraging on hypo-hybrid, we have created a diploid genome assembly pipeline called hypo-assembler. Hypo-assembler automates the generation of highly accurate, contiguous and nearly complete diploid assemblies using ONT long reads, Illumina short reads and optionally Hi-C reads. Notably, our solution even allows for the production of telomere-to-telomere diploid genomes with additional manual steps. As a proof of concept, we successfully assembled a fully phased telomere-to-telomere diploid genome of HG00733, achieving a quality value exceeding 50."
85,Learning structural heterogeneity from cryo-electron sub-tomograms with tomoDRGN,"Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables observation of macromolecular complexes in their native, spatially contextualized cellular environment. Cryo-ET processing software to visualize such complexes at nanometer resolution via iterative alignment and averaging are well developed but rely upon assumptions of structural homogeneity among the complexes of interest. Recently developed tools allow for some assessment of structural diversity but have limited capacity to represent highly heterogeneous structures, including those undergoing continuous conformational changes. Here we extend the highly expressive cryoDRGN (Deep Reconstructing Generative Networks) deep learning architecture, originally created for single-particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis, to cryo-ET. Our new tool, tomoDRGN, learns a continuous low-dimensional representation of structural heterogeneity in cryo-ET datasets while also learning to reconstruct heterogeneous structural ensembles supported by the underlying data. Using simulated and experimental data, we describe and benchmark architectural choices within tomoDRGN that are uniquely necessitated and enabled by cryo-ET. We additionally illustrate tomoDRGN’s efficacy in analyzing diverse datasets, using it to reveal high-level organization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) capsid complexes assembled in virus-like particles and to resolve extensive structural heterogeneity among ribosomes imaged in situ."
86,The defensome of complex bacterial communities,"Bacteria have developed various defense mechanisms to avoid infection and killing in response to the fast evolution and turnover of viruses and other genetic parasites. Such pan-immune system (
defensome
) encompasses a growing number of defense lines that include well-studied innate and adaptive systems such as restriction-modification, CRISPR-Cas and abortive infection, but also newly found ones whose mechanisms are still poorly understood. While the abundance and distribution of defense systems is well-known in complete and culturable genomes, there is a void in our understanding of their diversity and richness in complex microbial communities. Here we performed a large-scale in-depth analysis of the defensomes of 7759 high-quality bacterial population genomes reconstructed from soil, marine, and human gut environments. We observed a wide variation in the frequency and nature of the defensome among large phyla, which correlated with lifestyle, genome size, habitat, and geographic background. The defensome’s genetic mobility, its clustering in defense islands, and genetic variability was found to be system-specific and shaped by the bacterial environment. Hence, our results provide a detailed picture of the multiple immune barriers present in environmentally distinct bacterial communities and set the stage for subsequent identification of novel and ingenious strategies of diversification among uncultivated microbes."
87,Viscosity-dependent control of protein synthesis and degradation,"It has been proposed that the concentration of proteins in the cytoplasm maximizes the speed of important biochemical reactions. Here we have used 
Xenopus
 egg extracts, which can be diluted or concentrated to yield a range of cytoplasmic protein concentrations, to test the effect of cytoplasmic concentration on mRNA translation and protein degradation. We find that protein synthesis rates are maximal in ~1x cytoplasm, whereas protein degradation continues to rise to a higher optimal concentration of ~1.8x. We show that this difference in optima can be attributed to a greater sensitivity of translation to cytoplasmic viscosity. The different concentration optima could produce a negative feedback homeostatic system, where increasing the cytoplasmic protein concentration above the 1x physiological level increases the viscosity of the cytoplasm, which selectively inhibits translation and drives the system back toward the 1x set point."
88,Machine learning predictor PSPire screens for phase-separating proteins lacking intrinsically disordered regions,"The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation (PS) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins (PSPs). These tools often skew towards PSPs with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), thus frequently undervaluing potential PSPs without IDRs. Nonetheless, PS is not only steered by IDRs but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren’t necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce PSPire, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of PSPs. Compared to current PSP predictors, PSPire shows a notable improvement in identifying PSPs without IDRs, which underscores the crucial role of non-IDR, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the PS process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of PSPire, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate PSPs confirmed to form condensates within cells."
89,DeepETPicker: Fast and accurate 3D particle picking for cryo-electron tomography using weakly supervised deep learning,"To solve three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules in situ, large numbers of particles often need to be picked from cryo-electron tomograms. However, adoption of automated particle-picking methods remains limited because of their technical limitations. To overcome the limitations, we develop DeepETPicker, a deep learning model for fast and accurate picking of particles from cryo-electron tomograms. Training of DeepETPicker requires only weak supervision with low numbers of simplified labels, reducing the burden of manual annotation. The simplified labels combined with the customized and lightweight model architecture of DeepETPicker and accelerated pooling enable substantial performance improvement. When tested on simulated and real tomograms, DeepETPicker outperforms the competing state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest overall accuracy and speed, which translate into higher authenticity and coordinates accuracy of picked particles and higher resolutions of final reconstruction maps. DeepETPicker is provided in open source with a user-friendly interface to support cryo-electron tomography in situ."
90,Diversity of sugar-diphospholipid-utilizing glycosyltransferase families,"Peptidoglycan polymerases, enterobacterial common antigen polymerases, O-antigen ligases, and other bacterial polysaccharide polymerases (BP-Pols) are glycosyltransferases (GTs) that build bacterial surface polysaccharides. These integral membrane enzymes share the particularity of using diphospholipid-activated sugars and were previously missing in the carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy; 
www.cazy.org
). While the first three classes formed well-defined families of similar proteins, the sequences of BP-Pols were so diverse that a single family could not be built. To address this, we developed a new clustering method using a combination of a sequence similarity network and hidden Markov model comparisons. Overall, we have defined 17 new GT families including 14 of BP-Pols. We find that the reaction stereochemistry appears to be conserved in each of the defined BP-Pol families, and that the BP-Pols within the families transfer similar sugars even across Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Comparison of the new GT families reveals three clans of distantly related families, which also conserve the reaction stereochemistry."
91,bacLIFE: a user-friendly computational workflow for genome analysis and prediction of lifestyle-associated genes in bacteria,"Bacteria have an extensive adaptive ability to live in close association with eukaryotic hosts, exhibiting detrimental, neutral or beneficial effects on host growth and health. However, the genes involved in niche adaptation are mostly unknown and their functions poorly characterized. Here, we present bacLIFE (
https://github.com/Carrion-lab/bacLIFE
) a streamlined computational workflow for genome annotation, large-scale comparative genomics, and prediction of lifestyle-associated genes (LAGs). As a proof of concept, we analyzed 16,846 genomes from the 
Burkholderia
/
Paraburkholderia
 and 
Pseudomonas
 genera, which led to the identification of hundreds of genes potentially associated with a plant pathogenic lifestyle. Site-directed mutagenesis of 14 of these predicted LAGs of unknown function, followed by plant bioassays, showed that 6 predicted LAGs are indeed involved in the phytopathogenic lifestyle of 
Burkholderia plantarii
 and 
Pseudomonas syringae
 pv. phaseolicola. These 6 LAGs encompassed a glycosyltransferase, extracellular binding proteins, homoserine dehydrogenases and hypothetical proteins. Collectively, our results highlight bacLIFE as an effective computational tool for prediction of LAGs and the generation of hypotheses for a better understanding of bacteria-host interactions."
92,Biosensor and machine learning-aided engineering of an amaryllidaceae enzyme,"A major challenge to achieving industry-scale biomanufacturing of therapeutic alkaloids is the slow process of biocatalyst engineering. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, such as the Alzheimer’s medication galantamine, are complex plant secondary metabolites with recognized therapeutic value. Due to their difficult synthesis they are regularly sourced by extraction and purification from the low-yielding daffodil 
Narcissus pseudonarcissus
. Here, we propose an efficient biosensor-machine learning technology stack for biocatalyst development, which we apply to engineer an Amaryllidaceae enzyme in 
Escherichia coli
. Directed evolution is used to develop a highly sensitive (EC
50
 = 20 μM) and specific biosensor for the key Amaryllidaceae alkaloid branchpoint 4’-O-methylnorbelladine. A structure-based residual neural network (MutComputeX) is subsequently developed and used to generate activity-enriched variants of a plant methyltransferase, which are rapidly screened with the biosensor. Functional enzyme variants are identified that yield a 60% improvement in product titer, 2-fold higher catalytic activity, and 3-fold lower off-product regioisomer formation. A solved crystal structure elucidates the mechanism behind key beneficial mutations."
93,Evolving copy number gains promote tumor expansion and bolster mutational diversification,"The timing and fitness effect of somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) in cancer evolution remains poorly understood. Here we present a framework to determine the timing of a clonal SCNA that encompasses multiple gains. This involves calculating the proportion of time from its last gain to the onset of population expansion (lead time) as well as the proportion of time prior to its first gain (initiation time). Our method capitalizes on the observation that a genomic segment, while in a specific copy number (CN) state, accumulates point mutations proportionally to its CN. Analyzing 184 whole genome sequenced samples from 75 patients across five tumor types, we commonly observe late gains following early initiating events, occurring just before the clonal expansion relevant to the sampling. These include gains acquired after genome doubling in more than 60% of cases. Notably, mathematical modeling suggests that late clonal gains may contain final-expansion drivers. Lastly, SCNAs bolster mutational diversification between subpopulations, exacerbating the circle of proliferation and increasing heterogeneity."
94,Building trust in deep learning-based immune response predictors with interpretable explanations,"The ability to predict whether a peptide will get presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules has profound implications in designing vaccines. Numerous deep learning-based predictors for peptide presentation on MHC class I molecules exist with high levels of accuracy. However, these MHC class I predictors are treated as black-box functions, providing little insight into their decision making. To build turst in these predictors, it is crucial to understand the rationale behind their decisions with human-interpretable explanations. We present MHCXAI, eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to help interpret the outputs from MHC class I predictors in terms of input peptide features. In our experiments, we explain the outputs of four state-of-the-art MHC class I predictors over a large dataset of peptides and MHC alleles. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability of the explanations by comparing against ground truth and checking their robustness. MHCXAI seeks to increase understanding of deep learning-based predictors in the immune response domain and build trust with validated explanations."
95,Deep learning model for personalized prediction of positive MRSA culture using time-series electronic health records,"Methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus
 (MRSA) poses significant morbidity and mortality in hospitals. Rapid, accurate risk stratification of MRSA is crucial for optimizing antibiotic therapy. Our study introduced a deep learning model, PyTorch_EHR, which leverages electronic health record (EHR) time-series data, including wide-variety patient specific data, to predict MRSA culture positivity within two weeks. 8,164 MRSA and 22,393 non-MRSA patient events from Memorial Hermann Hospital System, Houston, Texas are used for model development. PyTorch_EHR outperforms logistic regression (LR) and light gradient boost machine (LGBM) models in accuracy (AUROC

This highlights the advantage of deep learning models in predicting MRSA positive cultures, surpassing traditional machine learning models and supporting clinicians’ judgments."
96,"Systematic analysis of ChatGPT, Google search and Llama 2 for clinical decision support tasks","It is likely that individuals are turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) to seek health advice, much like searching for diagnoses on Google. We evaluate clinical accuracy of GPT-3·5 and GPT-4 for suggesting initial diagnosis, examination steps and treatment of 110 medical cases across diverse clinical disciplines. Moreover, two model configurations of the Llama 2 open source LLMs are assessed in a sub-study. For benchmarking the diagnostic task, we conduct a naïve Google search for comparison. Overall, GPT-4 performed best with superior performances over GPT-3·5 considering diagnosis and examination and superior performance over Google for diagnosis. Except for treatment, better performance on frequent vs rare diseases is evident for all three approaches. The sub-study indicates slightly lower performances for Llama models. In conclusion, the commercial LLMs show growing potential for medical question answering in two successive major releases. However, some weaknesses underscore the need for robust and regulated AI models in health care. Open source LLMs can be a viable option to address specific needs regarding data privacy and transparency of training."
97,Riboformer: a deep learning framework for predicting context-dependent translation dynamics,"Translation elongation is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis, and alterations in the translational landscape are associated with a range of diseases. Ribosome profiling allows detailed measurements of translation at the genome scale. However, it remains unclear how to disentangle biological variations from technical artifacts in these data and identify sequence determinants of translation dysregulation. Here we present Riboformer, a deep learning-based framework for modeling context-dependent changes in translation dynamics. Riboformer leverages the transformer architecture to accurately predict ribosome densities at codon resolution. When trained on an unbiased dataset, Riboformer corrects experimental artifacts in previously unseen datasets, which reveals subtle differences in synonymous codon translation and uncovers a bottleneck in translation elongation. Further, we show that Riboformer can be combined with in silico mutagenesis to identify sequence motifs that contribute to ribosome stalling across various biological contexts, including aging and viral infection. Our tool offers a context-aware and interpretable approach for standardizing ribosome profiling datasets and elucidating the regulatory basis of translation kinetics."
98,"EVATOM: an optical, label-free, machine learning assisted embryo health assessment tool","The combination of a good quality embryo and proper maternal health factors promise higher chances of a successful in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure leading to clinical pregnancy and live birth. Of these two factors, selection of a good embryo is a controllable aspect. The current gold standard in clinical practice is visual assessment of an embryo based on its morphological appearance by trained embryologists. More recently, machine learning has been incorporated into embryo selection “packages”. Here, we report EVATOM: a machine-learning assisted embryo health assessment tool utilizing an optical quantitative phase imaging technique called artificial confocal microscopy (ACM). We present a label-free nucleus detection method with, to the best of our knowledge, novel quantitative embryo health biomarkers. Two viability assessment models are presented for grading embryos into two classes: healthy/intermediate (H/I) or sick (S) class. The models achieve a weighted F1 score of 1.0 and 0.99 respectively on the in-distribution test set of 72 fixed embryos and a weighted F1 score of 0.9 and 0.95 respectively on the out-of-distribution test dataset of 19 time-instances from 8 live embryos."
99,Machine learning-aided design and screening of an emergent protein function in synthetic cells,"Recently, utilization of Machine Learning (ML) has led to astonishing progress in computational protein design, bringing into reach the targeted engineering of proteins for industrial and biomedical applications. However, the design of proteins for emergent functions of core relevance to cells, such as the ability to spatiotemporally self-organize and thereby structure the cellular space, is still extremely challenging. While on the generative side conditional generative models and multi-state design are on the rise, for emergent functions there is a lack of tailored screening methods as typically needed in a protein design project, both computational and experimental. Here we describe a proof-of-principle of how such screening, in silico and in vitro, can be achieved for ML-generated variants of a protein that forms intracellular spatiotemporal patterns. For computational screening we use a structure-based divide-and-conquer approach to find the most promising candidates, while for the subsequent in vitro screening we use synthetic cell-mimics as established by Bottom-Up Synthetic Biology. We then show that the best screened candidate can indeed completely substitute the wildtype gene in 
Escherichia coli
. These results raise great hopes for the next level of synthetic biology, where ML-designed synthetic proteins will be used to engineer cellular functions."
100,"Regulation of developmental gatekeeping and cell fate transition by the calpain protease DEK1 in 
Physcomitrium patens","Calpains are cysteine proteases that control cell fate transitions whose loss of function causes severe, pleiotropic phenotypes in eukaryotes. Although mainly considered as modulatory proteases, human calpain targets are directed to the N-end rule degradation pathway. Several such targets are transcription factors, hinting at a gene-regulatory role. Here, we analyze the gene-regulatory networks of the moss 
Physcomitrium patens
 and characterize the regulons that are misregulated in mutants of the calpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1). Predicted cleavage patterns of the regulatory hierarchies in five DEK1-controlled subnetworks are consistent with a pleiotropic and regulatory role during cell fate transitions targeting multiple functions. Network structure suggests DEK1-gated sequential transitions between cell fates in 2D-to-3D development. Our method combines comprehensive phenotyping, transcriptomics and data science to dissect phenotypic traits, and our model explains the protease function as a switch gatekeeping cell fate transitions potentially also beyond plant development."
101,ScLinear predicts protein abundance at single-cell resolution,"Single-cell multi-omics have transformed biomedical research and present exciting machine learning opportunities. We present scLinear, a linear regression-based approach that predicts single-cell protein abundance based on RNA expression. ScLinear is vastly more efficient than state-of-the-art methodologies, without compromising its accuracy. ScLinear is interpretable and accurately generalizes in unseen single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. Importantly, we offer a critical view in using complex algorithms ignoring simpler, faster, and more efficient approaches."
102,Spatial landmark detection and tissue registration with deep learning,"Spatial landmarks are crucial in describing histological features between samples or sites, tracking regions of interest in microscopy, and registering tissue samples within a common coordinate framework. Although other studies have explored unsupervised landmark detection, existing methods are not well-suited for histological image data as they often require a large number of images to converge, are unable to handle nonlinear deformations between tissue sections and are ineffective for 
z
-stack alignment, other modalities beyond image data or multimodal data. We address these challenges by introducing effortless landmark detection, a new unsupervised landmark detection and registration method using neural-network-guided thin-plate splines. Our proposed method is evaluated on a diverse range of datasets including histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and stability compared to existing approaches."
103,Enhancing the fairness of AI prediction models by Quasi-Pareto improvement among heterogeneous thyroid nodule population,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for medical diagnosis often face challenges of generalizability and fairness. We highlighted the algorithmic unfairness in a large thyroid ultrasound dataset with significant diagnostic performance disparities across subgroups linked causally to sample size imbalances. To address this, we introduced the Quasi-Pareto Improvement (QPI) approach and a deep learning implementation (QP-Net) combining multi-task learning and domain adaptation to improve model performance among disadvantaged subgroups without compromising overall population performance. On the thyroid ultrasound dataset, our method significantly mitigated the area under curve (AUC) disparity for three less-prevalent subgroups by 0.213, 0.112, and 0.173 while maintaining the AUC for dominant subgroups; we also further confirmed the generalizability of our approach on two public datasets: the ISIC2019 skin disease dataset and the CheXpert chest radiograph dataset. Here we show the QPI approach to be widely applicable in promoting AI for equitable healthcare outcomes."
104,A coarse-grained bacterial cell model for resource-aware analysis and design of synthetic gene circuits,"Within a cell, synthetic and native genes compete for expression machinery, influencing cellular process dynamics through resource couplings. Models that simplify competitive resource binding kinetics can guide the design of strategies for countering these couplings. However, in bacteria resource availability and cell growth rate are interlinked, which complicates resource-aware biocircuit design. Capturing this interdependence requires coarse-grained bacterial cell models that balance accurate representation of metabolic regulation against simplicity and interpretability. We propose a coarse-grained 
E. coli
 cell model that combines the ease of simplified resource coupling analysis with appreciation of bacterial growth regulation mechanisms and the processes relevant for biocircuit design. Reliably capturing known growth phenomena, it provides a unifying explanation to disparate empirical relations between growth and synthetic gene expression. Considering a biomolecular controller that makes cell-wide ribosome availability robust to perturbations, we showcase our model’s usefulness in numerically prototyping biocircuits and deriving analytical relations for design guidance."
105,Domain generalization enables general cancer cell annotation in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics,"Single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing, two recently optimized transcriptome sequencing methods, are increasingly used to study cancer and related diseases. Cell annotation, particularly for malignant cell annotation, is essential and crucial for in-depth analyses in these studies. However, current algorithms lack accuracy and generalization, making it difficult to consistently and rapidly infer malignant cells from pan-cancer data. To address this issue, we present Cancer-Finder, a domain generalization-based deep-learning algorithm that can rapidly identify malignant cells in single-cell data with an average accuracy of 95.16%. More importantly, by replacing the single-cell training data with spatial transcriptomic datasets, Cancer-Finder can accurately identify malignant spots on spatial slides. Applying Cancer-Finder to 5 clear cell renal cell carcinoma spatial transcriptomic samples, Cancer-Finder demonstrates a good ability to identify malignant spots and identifies a gene signature consisting of 10 genes that are significantly co-localized and enriched at the tumor-normal interface and have a strong correlation with the prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients. In conclusion, Cancer-Finder is an efficient and extensible tool for malignant cell annotation."
106,Widespread stable noncanonical peptides identified by integrated analyses of ribosome profiling and ORF features,"Studies have revealed dozens of functional peptides in putative ‘noncoding’ regions and raised the question of how many proteins are encoded by noncanonical open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we comprehensively annotate genome-wide translated ORFs across five eukaryotes (
human
, 
mouse
, 
zebrafish
, 
worm
, and 
yeast
) by analyzing ribosome profiling data. We develop a logistic regression model named PepScore based on ORF features (expected length, encoded domain, and conservation) to calculate the probability that the encoded peptide is stable in 
humans
. Systematic ectopic expression validates PepScore and shows that stable complex-associating microproteins can be encoded in 5’/3’ untranslated regions and overlapping coding regions of mRNAs besides annotated noncoding RNAs. Stable noncanonical proteins follow conventional rules and localize to different subcellular compartments. Inhibition of proteasomal/lysosomal degradation pathways can stabilize some peptides especially those with moderate PepScores, but cannot rescue the expression of short ones with low PepScores suggesting they are directly degraded by cellular proteases. The majority of 
human
 noncanonical peptides with high PepScores show longer lengths but low conservation across species/mammals, and hundreds contain trait-associated genetic variants. Our study presents a statistical framework to identify stable noncanonical peptides in the genome and provides a valuable resource for functional characterization of noncanonical translation during development and disease."
107,Unraveling the transcriptomic landscape of eye migration and visual adaptations during flatfish metamorphosis,"Flatfish undergo a remarkable metamorphosis from symmetrical pelagic larvae to fully asymmetrical benthic juveniles. The most distinctive features of this transformation is the migration of one eye. The molecular role of thyroid hormone in the metamorphosis process in flatfishes is well established. However, the regulatory network that facilitates eye movement remains enigmatic. This paper presents a morphological investigation of the metamorphic process in turbot eyes, using advanced imaging techniques and a global view of gene expression. The study covers migrant and non-migrant eyes and aims to identify the genes that are active during ocular migration. Our transcriptomic analysis shows a significant up-regulation of immune-related genes. The analysis of eye-specific genes reveals distinct patterns during the metamorphic process. Myosin is highlighted in the non-migrant eye, while ependymin is highlighted in the migrant eye, possibly involved in optic nerve regeneration. Furthermore, a potential association between the 
alx3
 gene and cranial restructuring has been identified. Additionally, it confirmed simultaneous adaptation to low light in both eyes, as described by changes in opsins expression during the metamorphic process. The study also revealed that ocular migration activates systems asynchronously in both eyes, providing insight into multifaceted reorganization processes during metamorphosis of flatfish."
108,Empirical data drift detection experiments on real-world medical imaging data,"While it is common to monitor deployed clinical artificial intelligence (AI) models for performance degradation, it is less common for the input data to be monitored for data drift – systemic changes to input distributions. However, when real-time evaluation may not be practical (eg., labeling costs) or when gold-labels are automatically generated, we argue that tracking data drift becomes a vital addition for AI deployments. In this work, we perform empirical experiments on real-world medical imaging to evaluate three data drift detection methods’ ability to detect data drift caused (a) naturally (emergence of COVID-19 in X-rays) and (b) synthetically. We find that monitoring performance alone is not a good proxy for detecting data drift and that drift-detection heavily depends on sample size and patient features. Our work discusses the need and utility of data drift detection in various scenarios and highlights gaps in knowledge for the practical application of existing methods."
109,Drug target prediction through deep learning functional representation of gene signatures,"Many machine learning applications in bioinformatics currently rely on matching gene identities when analyzing input gene signatures and fail to take advantage of preexisting knowledge about gene functions. To further enable comparative analysis of OMICS datasets, including target deconvolution and mechanism of action studies, we develop an approach that represents gene signatures projected onto their biological functions, instead of their identities, similar to how the word2vec technique works in natural language processing. We develop the Functional Representation of Gene Signatures (FRoGS) approach by training a deep learning model and demonstrate that its application to the Broad Institute’s L1000 datasets results in more effective compound-target predictions than models based on gene identities alone. By integrating additional pharmacological activity data sources, FRoGS significantly increases the number of high-quality compound-target predictions relative to existing approaches, many of which are supported by in silico and/or experimental evidence. These results underscore the general utility of FRoGS in machine learning-based bioinformatics applications. Prediction networks pre-equipped with the knowledge of gene functions may help uncover new relationships among gene signatures acquired by large-scale OMICs studies on compounds, cell types, disease models, and patient cohorts."
110,Membrane lipids drive formation of KRAS4b-RAF1 RBDCRD nanoclusters on the membrane,"The oncogene RAS, extensively studied for decades, presents persistent gaps in understanding, hindering the development of effective therapeutic strategies due to a lack of precise details on how RAS initiates MAPK signaling with RAF effector proteins at the plasma membrane. Recent advances in X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy offer structural and spatial insights, yet the molecular mechanisms involving protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in RAS-mediated signaling require further characterization. This study utilizes single-molecule experimental techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the computational Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI) to examine KRAS4b and RAF1 on a biologically relevant lipid bilayer. MuMMI captures long-timescale events while preserving detailed atomic descriptions, providing testable models for experimental validation. Both in vitro and computational studies reveal that RBDCRD binding alters KRAS lateral diffusion on the lipid bilayer, increasing cluster size and decreasing diffusion. RAS and membrane binding cause hydrophobic residues in the CRD region to penetrate the bilayer, stabilizing complexes through β-strand elongation. These cooperative interactions among lipids, KRAS4b, and RAF1 are proposed as essential for forming nanoclusters, potentially a critical step in MAP kinase signal activation."
111,Hypermethylated genome of a fish vertebrate iridovirus ISKNV plays important roles in viral infection,"Iridoviruses are nucleocytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses that infect invertebrates and ectothermic vertebrates. The hypermethylated genome of vertebrate iridoviruses is unique among animal viruses. However, the map and function of iridovirus genomic methylation remain unknown. Herein, the methylated genome of Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV, a fish iridovirus), and its role in viral infection, are investigated. The methylation level of ISKNV is 23.44%. The hypermethylated genome is essential for ISKNV amplification, but there is no correlation between hypermethylation and viral gene expression. The hypomethylated ISKNV (obtained via 5-Azacytidine) activates a strong immunoreaction in vitro and reduces its pathogenicity in vivo. The unmethylated viral DNA can induce a stronger immunoreaction in vitro, whereas inactivated hypomethylated ISKNV can induce a stronger immunoreaction in vivo, suggesting ISKNV may evade from immune system by increasing its genome methylation level. Our work provides new insights into the role of genome methylation in viral infection."
112,A framework for evaluating clinical artificial intelligence systems without ground-truth annotations,"A clinical artificial intelligence (AI) system is often validated on data withheld during its development. This provides an estimate of its performance upon future deployment on data in the wild; those currently unseen but are expected to be encountered in a clinical setting. However, estimating performance on data in the wild is complicated by distribution shift between data in the wild and withheld data and the absence of ground-truth annotations. Here, we introduce SUDO, a framework for evaluating AI systems on data in the wild. Through experiments on AI systems developed for dermatology images, histopathology patches, and clinical notes, we show that SUDO can identify unreliable predictions, inform the selection of models, and allow for the previously out-of-reach assessment of algorithmic bias for data in the wild without ground-truth annotations. These capabilities can contribute to the deployment of trustworthy and ethical AI systems in medicine."
113,Prediction of plasma ctDNA fraction and prognostic implications of liquid biopsy in advanced prostate cancer,"No consensus strategies exist for prognosticating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Circulating tumor DNA fraction (ctDNA%) is increasingly reported by commercial and laboratory tests but its utility for risk stratification is unclear. Here, we intersect ctDNA%, treatment outcomes, and clinical characteristics across 738 plasma samples from 491 male mCRPC patients from two randomized multicentre phase II trials and a prospective province-wide blood biobanking program. ctDNA% correlates with serum and radiographic metrics of disease burden and is highest in patients with liver metastases. ctDNA% strongly predicts overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment response independent of therapeutic context and outperformed established prognostic clinical factors. Recognizing that ctDNA-based biomarker genotyping is limited by low ctDNA% in some patients, we leverage the relationship between clinical prognostic factors and ctDNA% to develop a clinically-interpretable machine-learning tool that predicts whether a patient has sufficient ctDNA% for informative ctDNA genotyping (available online: 
https://www.ctDNA.org
). Our results affirm ctDNA% as an actionable tool for patient risk stratification and provide a practical framework for optimized biomarker testing."
114,Functional regulation of aquaporin dynamics by lipid bilayer composition,"With the diversity of lipid-protein interactions, any observed membrane protein dynamics or functions directly depend on the lipid bilayer selection. However, the implications of lipid bilayer choice are seldom considered unless characteristic lipid-protein interactions have been previously reported. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we characterize the effects of membrane embedding on plant aquaporin SoPIP2;1, which has no reported high-affinity lipid interactions. The regulatory impacts of a realistic lipid bilayer, and nine different homogeneous bilayers, on varying SoPIP2;1 dynamics are examined. We demonstrate that SoPIP2;1’s structure, thermodynamics, kinetics, and water transport are altered as a function of each membrane construct’s ensemble properties. Notably, the realistic bilayer provides stabilization of non-functional SoPIP2;1 metastable states. Hydrophobic mismatch and lipid order parameter calculations further explain how lipid ensemble properties manipulate SoPIP2;1 behavior. Our results illustrate the importance of careful bilayer selection when studying membrane proteins. To this end, we advise cautionary measures when performing membrane protein molecular dynamics simulations."
115,Rare disease research workflow using multilayer networks elucidates the molecular determinants of severity in Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes,"Exploring the molecular basis of disease severity in rare disease scenarios is a challenging task provided the limitations on data availability. Causative genes have been described for Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS), a group of diverse minority neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorders; yet a molecular explanation for the phenotypic severity differences remains unclear. Here, we present a workflow to explore the functional relationships between CMS causal genes and altered genes from each patient, based on multilayer network community detection analysis of complementary biomedical information provided by relevant data sources, namely protein-protein interactions, pathways and metabolomics. Our results show that CMS severity can be ascribed to the personalized impairment of extracellular matrix components and postsynaptic modulators of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. This work showcases how coupling multilayer network analysis with personalized -omics information provides molecular explanations to the varying severity of rare diseases; paving the way for sorting out similar cases in other rare diseases."
116,Automatic data-driven design and 3D printing of custom ocular prostheses,"Millions of people require custom ocular prostheses due to eye loss or congenital defects. The current fully manual manufacturing processes used by highly skilled ocularists are time-consuming with varying quality. Additive manufacturing technology has the potential to simplify the manufacture of ocular prosthetics, but existing approaches just replace to various degrees craftsmanship by manual digital design and still require substantial expertise and time. Here we present an automatic digital end-to-end process for producing custom ocular prostheses that uses image data from an anterior segment optical coherence tomography device and considers both shape and appearance. Our approach uses a statistical shape model to predict, based on incomplete surface information of the eye socket, a best fitting prosthesis shape. We use a colour characterized image of the healthy fellow eye to determine and procedurally generate the prosthesis’s appearance that matches the fellow eye. The prosthesis is manufactured using a multi-material full-colour 3D printer and postprocessed to satisfy regulatory compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results for 10 clinic patients who received a 3D printed prosthesis. Compared to a current manual process, our approach requires five times less labour of the ocularist and produces reproducible output."
117,A release of local subunit conformational heterogeneity underlies gating in a muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,"Synaptic receptors respond to neurotransmitters by opening an ion channel across the post-synaptic membrane to elicit a cellular response. Here we use recent 
Torpedo
 acetylcholine receptor structures and functional measurements to delineate a key feature underlying allosteric communication between the agonist-binding extracellular and channel-gating transmembrane domains. Extensive mutagenesis at this inter-domain interface re-affirms a critical energetically coupled role for the principal α subunit β1-β2 and M2-M3 loops, with agonist binding re-positioning a key β1-β2 glutamate/valine to facilitate the outward motions of a conserved M2-M3 proline to open the channel gate. Notably, the analogous structures in non-α subunits adopt a locally active-like conformation in the apo state even though each L9’ hydrophobic gate residue in each pore-lining M2 α-helix is closed. Agonist binding releases local conformational heterogeneity transitioning all five subunits into a conformationally symmetric open state. A release of conformational heterogeneity provides a framework for understanding allosteric communication in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels."
118,Statistical method scDEED for detecting dubious 2D single-cell embeddings and optimizing t-SNE and UMAP hyperparameters,"Two-dimensional (2D) embedding methods are crucial for single-cell data visualization. Popular methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) are commonly used for visualizing cell clusters; however, it is well known that t-SNE and UMAP’s 2D embeddings might not reliably inform the similarities among cell clusters. Motivated by this challenge, we present a statistical method, scDEED, for detecting dubious cell embeddings output by a 2D-embedding method. By calculating a reliability score for every cell embedding based on the similarity between the cell’s 2D-embedding neighbors and pre-embedding neighbors, scDEED identifies the cell embeddings with low reliability scores as dubious and those with high reliability scores as trustworthy. Moreover, by minimizing the number of dubious cell embeddings, scDEED provides intuitive guidance for optimizing the hyperparameters of an embedding method. We show the effectiveness of scDEED on multiple datasets for detecting dubious cell embeddings and optimizing the hyperparameters of t-SNE and UMAP."
119,scGPT: toward building a foundation model for single-cell multi-omics using generative AI,"Generative pretrained models have achieved remarkable success in various domains such as language and computer vision. Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pretrained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications. This includes tasks such as cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, perturbation response prediction and gene network inference."
120,A distinct class of pan-cancer susceptibility genes revealed by an alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association study,"Alternative polyadenylation plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression; however, current transcriptome-wide association studies mostly ignore alternative polyadenylation when identifying putative cancer susceptibility genes. Here, we perform a pan-cancer 3′ untranslated region alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association analysis by integrating 55 well-powered (
n
 > 50,000) genome-wide association studies datasets across 22 major cancer types with alternative polyadenylation quantification from 23,955 RNA sequencing samples across 7,574 individuals. We find that genetic variants associated with alternative polyadenylation are co-localized with 28.57% of cancer loci and contribute a significant portion of cancer heritability. We further identify 642 significant cancer susceptibility genes predicted to modulate cancer risk via alternative polyadenylation, 62.46% of which have been overlooked by traditional expression- and splicing- studies. As proof of principle validation, we show that alternative alleles facilitate 3′ untranslated region lengthening of 
CRLS1
 gene leading to increased protein abundance and promoted proliferation of breast cancer cells. Together, our study highlights the significant role of alternative polyadenylation in discovering new cancer susceptibility genes and provides a strong foundational framework for enhancing our understanding of the etiology underlying human cancers."
121,SEMORE: SEgmentation and MORphological fingErprinting by machine learning automates super-resolution data analysis,"The morphology of protein assemblies impacts their behaviour and contributes to beneficial and aberrant cellular responses. While single-molecule localization microscopy provides the required spatial resolution to investigate these assemblies, the lack of universal robust analytical tools to extract and quantify underlying structures limits this powerful technique. Here we present SEMORE, a semi-automatic machine learning framework for universal, system- and input-dependent, analysis of super-resolution data. SEMORE implements a multi-layered density-based clustering module to dissect biological assemblies and a morphology fingerprinting module for quantification by multiple geometric and kinetics-based descriptors. We demonstrate SEMORE on simulations and diverse raw super-resolution data: time-resolved insulin aggregates, and published data of dSTORM imaging of nuclear pore complexes, fibroblast growth receptor 1, sptPALM of Syntaxin 1a and dynamic live-cell PALM of ryanodine receptors. SEMORE extracts and quantifies all protein assemblies, their temporal morphology evolution and provides quantitative insights, e.g. classification of heterogeneous insulin aggregation pathways and NPC geometry in minutes. SEMORE is a general analysis platform for super-resolution data, and being a time-aware framework can also support the rise of 4D super-resolution data."
122,Transfer learning with graph neural networks for improved molecular property prediction in the multi-fidelity setting,"We investigate the potential of graph neural networks for transfer learning and improving molecular property prediction on sparse and expensive to acquire high-fidelity data by leveraging low-fidelity measurements as an inexpensive proxy for a targeted property of interest. This problem arises in discovery processes that rely on screening funnels for trading off the overall costs against throughput and accuracy. Typically, individual stages in these processes are loosely connected and each one generates data at different scale and fidelity. We consider this setup holistically and demonstrate empirically that existing transfer learning techniques for graph neural networks are generally unable to harness the information from multi-fidelity cascades. Here, we propose several effective transfer learning strategies and study them in transductive and inductive settings. Our analysis involves a collection of more than 28 million unique experimental protein-ligand interactions across 37 targets from drug discovery by high-throughput screening and 12 quantum properties from the dataset QMugs. The results indicate that transfer learning can improve the performance on sparse tasks by up to eight times while using an order of magnitude less high-fidelity training data. Moreover, the proposed methods consistently outperform existing transfer learning strategies for graph-structured data on drug discovery and quantum mechanics datasets."
123,Rapid deep learning-assisted predictive diagnostics for point-of-care testing,"Prominent techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and rapid kits are currently being explored to both enhance sensitivity and reduce assay time for diagnostic tests. Existing commercial molecular methods typically take several hours, while immunoassays can range from several hours to tens of minutes. Rapid diagnostics are crucial in Point-of-Care Testing (POCT). We propose an approach that integrates a time-series deep learning architecture and AI-based verification, for the enhanced result analysis of lateral flow assays. This approach is applicable to both infectious diseases and non-infectious biomarkers. In blind tests using clinical samples, our method achieved diagnostic times as short as 2 minutes, exceeding the accuracy of human analysis at 15 minutes. Furthermore, our technique significantly reduces assay time to just 1-2 minutes in the POCT setting. This advancement has the potential to greatly enhance POCT diagnostics, enabling both healthcare professionals and non-experts to make rapid, accurate decisions."
124,Metabolomic machine learning predictor for diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer,"Gastric cancer (GC) represents a significant burden of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring an urgent need for the development of early detection strategies and precise postoperative interventions. However, the identification of non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and patient risk stratification remains underexplored. Here, we conduct a targeted metabolomics analysis of 702 plasma samples from multi-center participants to elucidate the GC metabolic reprogramming. Our machine learning analysis reveals a 10-metabolite GC diagnostic model, which is validated in an external test set with a sensitivity of 0.905, outperforming conventional methods leveraging cancer protein markers (sensitivity < 0.40). Additionally, our machine learning-derived prognostic model demonstrates superior performance to traditional models utilizing clinical parameters and effectively stratifies patients into different risk groups to guide precision interventions. Collectively, our findings reveal the metabolic landscape of GC and identify two distinct biomarker panels that enable early detection and prognosis prediction respectively, thus facilitating precision medicine in GC."
125,Complex regulatory networks influence pluripotent cell state transitions in human iPSCs,"Stem cells exist in vitro in a spectrum of interconvertible pluripotent states. Analyzing hundreds of hiPSCs derived from different individuals, we show the proportions of these pluripotent states vary considerably across lines. We discover 13 gene network modules (GNMs) and 13 regulatory network modules (RNMs), which are highly correlated with each other suggesting that the coordinated co-accessibility of regulatory elements in the RNMs likely underlie the coordinated expression of genes in the GNMs. Epigenetic analyses reveal that regulatory networks underlying self-renewal and pluripotency are more complex than previously realized. Genetic analyses identify thousands of regulatory variants that overlapped predicted transcription factor binding sites and are associated with chromatin accessibility in the hiPSCs. We show that the master regulator of pluripotency, the NANOG-OCT4 Complex, and its associated network are significantly enriched for regulatory variants with large effects, suggesting that they play a role in the varying cellular proportions of pluripotency states between hiPSCs. Our work bins tens of thousands of regulatory elements in hiPSCs into discrete regulatory networks, shows that pluripotency and self-renewal processes have a surprising level of regulatory complexity, and suggests that genetic factors may contribute to cell state transitions in human iPSC lines."
126,scCASE: accurate and interpretable enhancement for single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data,"Single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scCAS) has emerged as a valuable tool for interrogating and elucidating epigenomic heterogeneity and gene regulation. However, scCAS data inherently suffers from limitations such as high sparsity and dimensionality, which pose significant challenges for downstream analyses. Although several methods are proposed to enhance scCAS data, there are still challenges and limitations that hinder the effectiveness of these methods. Here, we propose scCASE, a scCAS data enhancement method based on non-negative matrix factorization which incorporates an iteratively updating cell-to-cell similarity matrix. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of scCASE over existing methods for scCAS data enhancement. The interpretable cell type-specific peaks identified by scCASE can provide valuable biological insights into cell subpopulations. Moreover, to leverage the large compendia of available omics data as a reference, we further expand scCASE to scCASER, which enables the incorporation of external reference data to improve enhancement performance."
127,Protein design using structure-based residue preferences,"Recent developments in protein design rely on large neural networks with up to 100s of millions of parameters, yet it is unclear which residue dependencies are critical for determining protein function. Here, we show that amino acid preferences at individual residues—without accounting for mutation interactions—explain much and sometimes virtually all of the combinatorial mutation effects across 8 datasets (R
2
 ~ 78-98%). Hence, few observations (~100 times the number of mutated residues) enable accurate prediction of held-out variant effects (Pearson r > 0.80). We hypothesized that the local structural contexts around a residue could be sufficient to predict mutation preferences, and develop an unsupervised approach termed CoVES (
Co

V
ariant 
E
ffects from 
S
tructure). Our results suggest that CoVES outperforms not just model-free methods but also similarly to complex models for creating functional and diverse protein variants. CoVES offers an effective alternative to complicated models for identifying functional protein mutations."
128,On the stability of canonical correlation analysis and partial least squares with application to brain-behavior associations,"Associations between datasets can be discovered through multivariate methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS). A requisite property for interpretability and generalizability of CCA/PLS associations is stability of their feature patterns. However, stability of CCA/PLS in high-dimensional datasets is questionable, as found in empirical characterizations. To study these issues systematically, we developed a generative modeling framework to simulate synthetic datasets. We found that when sample size is relatively small, but comparable to typical studies, CCA/PLS associations are highly unstable and inaccurate; both in their magnitude and importantly in the feature pattern underlying the association. We confirmed these trends across two neuroimaging modalities and in independent datasets with 
n
 ≈ 1000 and 
n
 = 20,000, and found that only the latter comprised sufficient observations for stable mappings between imaging-derived and behavioral features. We further developed a power calculator to provide sample sizes required for stability and reliability of multivariate analyses. Collectively, we characterize how to limit detrimental effects of overfitting on CCA/PLS stability, and provide recommendations for future studies."
129,Design of target specific peptide inhibitors using generative deep learning and molecular dynamics simulations,"We introduce a computational approach for the design of target-specific peptides. Our method integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit-based Variational Autoencoder with Rosetta FlexPepDock for peptide sequence generation and binding affinity assessment. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to narrow down the selection of peptides for experimental assays. We apply this computational strategy to design peptide inhibitors that specifically target 
β
-catenin and NF-
κ
B essential modulator. Among the twelve 
β
-catenin inhibitors, six exhibit improved binding affinity compared to the parent peptide. Notably, the best C-terminal peptide binds 
β
-catenin with an IC
50
 of 0.010 ± 0.06 μM, which is 15-fold better than the parent peptide. For NF-
κ
B essential modulator, two of the four tested peptides display substantially enhanced binding compared to the parent peptide. Collectively, this study underscores the successful integration of deep learning and structure-based modeling and simulation for target specific peptide design."
130,Accurate global and local 3D alignment of cryo-EM density maps using local spatial structural features,"Advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging technologies have led to a rapidly increasing number of cryo-EM density maps. Alignment and comparison of density maps play a crucial role in interpreting structural information, such as conformational heterogeneity analysis using global alignment and atomic model assembly through local alignment. Here, we present a fast and accurate global and local cryo-EM density map alignment method called CryoAlign, that leverages local density feature descriptors to capture spatial structure similarities. CryoAlign is a feature-based cryo-EM map alignment tool, in which the employment of feature-based architecture enables the rapid establishment of point pair correspondences and robust estimation of alignment parameters. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of CryoAlign over the existing methods in terms of both alignment accuracy and speed."
131,Learning representations for image-based profiling of perturbations,"Measuring the phenotypic effect of treatments on cells through imaging assays is an efficient and powerful way of studying cell biology, and requires computational methods for transforming images into quantitative data. Here, we present an improved strategy for learning representations of treatment effects from high-throughput imaging, following a causal interpretation. We use weakly supervised learning for modeling associations between images and treatments, and show that it encodes both confounding factors and phenotypic features in the learned representation. To facilitate their separation, we constructed a large training dataset with images from five different studies to maximize experimental diversity, following insights from our causal analysis. Training a model with this dataset successfully improves downstream performance, and produces a reusable convolutional network for image-based profiling, which we call Cell Painting CNN. We evaluated our strategy on three publicly available Cell Painting datasets, and observed that the Cell Painting CNN improves performance in downstream analysis up to 30% with respect to classical features, while also being more computationally efficient."
132,Efficient encoding of large antigenic spaces by epitope prioritization with Dolphyn,"We investigate a relatively underexplored component of the gut-immune axis by profiling the antibody response to gut phages using Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). To cover large antigenic spaces, we develop Dolphyn, a method that uses machine learning to select peptides from protein sets and compresses the proteome through epitope-stitching. Dolphyn compresses the size of a peptide library by 78% compared to traditional tiling, increasing the antibody-reactive peptides from 10% to 31%. We find that the immune system develops antibodies to human gut bacteria-infecting viruses, particularly 
E.coli
-infecting 
Myoviridae
. Cost-effective PhIP-Seq libraries designed with Dolphyn enable the assessment of a wider range of proteins in a single experiment, thus facilitating the study of the gut-immune axis."
133,"Multi-omics analysis in human retina uncovers ultraconserved 
cis
-regulatory elements at rare eye disease loci","Cross-species genome comparisons have revealed a substantial number of ultraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). Several of these elements have proved to be essential tissue- and cell type-specific 
cis
-regulators of developmental gene expression. Here, we characterize a set of UCNEs as candidate CREs (cCREs) during retinal development and evaluate the contribution of their genomic variation to rare eye diseases, for which pathogenic non-coding variants are emerging. Integration of bulk and single-cell retinal multi-omics data reveals 594 genes under potential 
cis
-regulatory control of UCNEs, of which 45 are implicated in rare eye disease. Mining of candidate 
cis
-regulatory UCNEs in WGS data derived from the rare eye disease cohort of Genomics England reveals 178 ultrarare variants within 84 UCNEs associated with 29 disease genes. Overall, we provide a comprehensive annotation of ultraconserved non-coding regions acting as cCREs during retinal development which can be targets of non-coding variation underlying rare eye diseases."
134,Large language models streamline automated machine learning for clinical studies,"A knowledge gap persists between machine learning (ML) developers (e.g., data scientists) and practitioners (e.g., clinicians), hampering the full utilization of ML for clinical data analysis. We investigated the potential of the ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), an extension of GPT-4, to bridge this gap and perform ML analyses efficiently. Real-world clinical datasets and study details from large trials across various medical specialties were presented to ChatGPT ADA without specific guidance. ChatGPT ADA autonomously developed state-of-the-art ML models based on the original study’s training data to predict clinical outcomes such as cancer development, cancer progression, disease complications, or biomarkers such as pathogenic gene sequences. Following the re-implementation and optimization of the published models, the head-to-head comparison of the ChatGPT ADA-crafted ML models and their respective manually crafted counterparts revealed no significant differences in traditional performance metrics (
p
 ≥ 0.072). Strikingly, the ChatGPT ADA-crafted ML models often outperformed their counterparts. In conclusion, ChatGPT ADA offers a promising avenue to democratize ML in medicine by simplifying complex data analyses, yet should enhance, not replace, specialized training and resources, to promote broader applications in medical research and practice."
135,Iterative design of training data to control intricate enzymatic reaction networks,"Kinetic modeling of in vitro enzymatic reaction networks is vital to understand and control the complex behaviors emerging from the nonlinear interactions inside. However, modeling is severely hampered by the lack of training data. Here, we introduce a methodology that combines an active learning-like approach and flow chemistry to efficiently create optimized datasets for a highly interconnected enzymatic reactions network with multiple sub-pathways. The optimal experimental design (OED) algorithm designs a sequence of out-of-equilibrium perturbations to maximize the information about the reaction kinetics, yielding a descriptive model that allows control of the output of the network towards any cost function. We experimentally validate the model by forcing the network to produce different product ratios while maintaining a minimum level of overall conversion efficiency. Our workflow scales with the complexity of the system and enables the optimization of previously unobtainable network outputs."
136,A statistical method for quantifying progenitor cells reveals incipient cell fate commitments,"Quantifying the number of progenitor cells that found an organ, tissue or cell population is of fundamental importance for understanding the development and homeostasis of a multicellular organism. Previous efforts rely on marker genes that are specifically expressed in progenitors. This strategy is, however, often hindered by the lack of ideal markers. Here we propose a general statistical method to quantify the progenitors of any tissues or cell populations in an organism, even in the absence of progenitor-specific markers, by exploring the cell phylogenetic tree that records the cell division history during development. The method, termed targeting coalescent analysis (TarCA), computes the probability that two randomly sampled cells of a tissue coalesce within the tissue-specific monophyletic clades. The inverse of this probability then serves as a measure of the progenitor number of the tissue. Both mathematic modeling and computer simulations demonstrated the high accuracy of TarCA, which was then validated using real data from nematode, fruit fly and mouse, all with related cell phylogenetic trees. We further showed that TarCA can be used to identify lineage-specific upregulated genes during embryogenesis, revealing incipient cell fate commitments in mouse embryos."
137,Longitudinal monitoring of the mouse brain reveals heterogenous network trajectories during aging,"The human aging brain is characterized by changes in network efficiency that are currently best captured through longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). These studies however are challenging due to the long human lifespan. Here we show that the mouse animal model with a much shorter lifespan allows us to follow the functional network organization over most of the animal’s adult lifetime. We used a longitudinal study of the functional connectivity of different brain regions with rs-fMRI under anesthesia. Our analysis uncovers network modules similar to those reported in younger mice and in humans (i.e., prefrontal/default mode network (DMN), somatomotor and somatosensory networks). Statistical analysis reveals different patterns of network reorganization during aging. Female mice showed a pattern akin to human aging, with de-differentiation of the connectome, mainly due to increases in connectivity of the prefrontal/DMN cortical networks to other modules. Our male cohorts revealed heterogenous aging patterns with only one group confirming the de- differentiation, while the majority showed an increase in connectivity of the somatomotor cortex to the Nucleus accumbens. In summary, in line with human work, our analysis in mice supports the concept of de-differentiation in the aging mammalian brain and reveals additional trajectories in aging mice networks."
138,Imputation of plasma lipid species to facilitate integration of lipidomic datasets,"Recent advancements in plasma lipidomic profiling methodology have significantly increased specificity and accuracy of lipid measurements. This evolution, driven by improved chromatographic and mass spectrometric resolution of newer platforms, has made it challenging to align datasets created at different times, or on different platforms. Here we present a framework for harmonising such plasma lipidomic datasets with different levels of granularity in their lipid measurements. Our method utilises elastic-net prediction models, constructed from high-resolution lipidomics reference datasets, to predict unmeasured lipid species in lower-resolution studies. The approach involves (1) constructing composite lipid measures in the reference dataset that map to less resolved lipids in the target dataset, (2) addressing discrepancies between aligned lipid species, (3) generating prediction models, (4) assessing their transferability into the targe dataset, and (5) evaluating their prediction accuracy. To demonstrate our approach, we used the AusDiab population-based cohort (747 lipid species) as the reference to impute unmeasured lipid species into the LIPID study (342 lipid species). Furthermore, we compared measured and imputed lipids in terms of parameter estimation and predictive performance, and validated imputations in an independent study. Our method for harmonising plasma lipidomic datasets will facilitate model validation and data integration efforts."
139,Unsupervised classification of brain-wide axons reveals the presubiculum neuronal projection blueprint,"We present a quantitative strategy to identify all projection neuron types from a given region with statistically different patterns of anatomical targeting. We first validate the technique with mouse primary motor cortex layer 6 data, yielding two clusters consistent with cortico-thalamic and intra-telencephalic neurons. We next analyze the presubiculum, a less-explored region, identifying five classes of projecting neurons with unique patterns of divergence, convergence, and specificity. We report several findings: individual classes target multiple subregions along defined functions; all hypothalamic regions are exclusively targeted by the same class also invading midbrain and agranular retrosplenial cortex; Cornu Ammonis receives input from a single class of presubicular axons also projecting to granular retrosplenial cortex; path distances from the presubiculum to the same targets differ significantly between classes, as do the path distances to distinct targets within most classes; the identified classes have highly non-uniform abundances; and presubicular somata are topographically segregated among classes. This study thus demonstrates that statistically distinct projections shed light on the functional organization of their circuit."
140,An agricultural digital twin for mandarins demonstrates the potential for individualized agriculture,"A digital twin is a digital representation that closely resembles or replicates a real world object by combining interdisciplinary knowledge and advanced technologies. Digital twins have been applied to various fields, including to the agricultural field. Given big data and systematic data management, digital twins can be used for predicting future outcomes. In this study, we endeavor to create an agricultural digital twin using mandarins as a model crop. We employ an Open API to aggregate data from various sources across Jeju Island, covering an area of approximately 185,000 hectares. The collected data are visualized and analyzed at regional, inter-orchard, and intra-orchard scales. We observe that the intra-orchard analysis explains the variation of fruit quality substantially more than the inter-orchard analysis. Our data visualization and analysis, incorporating statistical models and machine learning algorithms, demonstrate the potential use of agricultural digital twins in the future, particularly in the context of micro-precision and individualized agriculture. This concept extends the current management practices based on data-driven decisions, and it offers a glimpse into the future of individualized agriculture by enabling customized treatment for plants, akin to personalized medicine for humans."
141,A mutational atlas for Parkin proteostasis,"Proteostasis can be disturbed by mutations affecting folding and stability of the encoded protein. An example is the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, where gene variants result in autosomal recessive Parkinsonism. To uncover the pathological mechanism and provide comprehensive genotype-phenotype information, variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) is leveraged to quantify the abundance of Parkin variants in cultured human cells. The resulting mutational map, covering 9219 out of the 9300 possible single-site amino acid substitutions and nonsense Parkin variants, shows that most low abundance variants are proteasome targets and are located within the structured domains of the protein. Half of the known disease-linked variants are found at low abundance. Systematic mapping of degradation signals (degrons) reveals an exposed degron region proximal to the so-called “activation element”. This work provides examples of how missense variants may cause degradation either via destabilization of the native protein, or by introducing local signals for degradation."
142,"Recurrent evolutionary switches of mitochondrial cytochrome 
c
 maturation systems in Archaeplastida","Mitochondrial cytochrome 
c
 maturation (CCM) requires heme attachment via distinct pathways termed systems I and III. The mosaic distribution of these systems in Archaeplastida raises questions about the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces promoting repeated evolution. Here, we show a recurrent shift from ancestral system I to the eukaryotic-specific holocytochrome 
c
 synthase (HCCS) of system III in 11 archaeplastid lineages. Archaeplastid HCCS is sufficient to rescue mutants of yeast system III and Arabidopsis system I. Algal HCCS mutants exhibit impaired growth and respiration, and altered biochemical and metabolic profiles, likely resulting from deficient CCM and reduced cytochrome 
c
-dependent respiratory activity. Our findings demonstrate that archaeplastid HCCS homologs function as system III components in the absence of system I. These results elucidate the evolutionary trajectory and functional divergence of CCM pathways in Archaeplastida, providing insight into the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of repeated cooption of an entire biological pathway."
143,"Identification of HDV-like 
theta
 ribozymes involved in tRNA-based recoding of gut bacteriophages","Trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiome, inhabit our bodies with the gut microbiome being of particular interest in biomedical research. Bacteriophages, the dominant virome constituents, can utilize suppressor tRNAs to switch to alternative genetic codes (e.g., the UAG stop-codon is reassigned to glutamine) while infecting hosts with the standard bacterial code. However, what triggers this switch and how the bacteriophage manipulates its host is poorly understood. Here, we report the discovery of a subgroup of minimal hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-like ribozymes – 
theta
 ribozymes – potentially involved in the code switch leading to the expression of recoded lysis and structural phage genes. We demonstrate their HDV-like self-scission behavior in vitro and find them in an unreported context often located with their cleavage site adjacent to tRNAs, indicating a role in viral tRNA maturation and/or regulation. Every fifth associated tRNA is a suppressor tRNA, further strengthening our hypothesis. The vast abundance of tRNA-associated 
theta
 ribozymes – we provide 1753 unique examples – highlights the importance of small ribozymes as an alternative to large enzymes that usually process tRNA 3’-ends. Our discovery expands the short list of biological functions of small HDV-like ribozymes and introduces a previously unknown player likely involved in the code switch of certain recoded gut bacteriophages."
144,Phage-plasmids promote recombination and emergence of phages and plasmids,"Phages and plasmids are regarded as distinct types of mobile genetic elements that drive bacterial evolution by horizontal gene transfer. However, the distinction between both types is blurred by the existence of elements known as prophage-plasmids or phage-plasmids, which transfer horizontally between cells as viruses and vertically within cellular lineages as plasmids. Here, we study gene flow between the three types of elements. We show that the gene repertoire of phage-plasmids overlaps with those of phages and plasmids. By tracking recent recombination events, we find that phage-plasmids exchange genes more frequently with plasmids than with phages, and that direct gene exchange between plasmids and phages is less frequent in comparison. The results suggest that phage-plasmids can mediate gene flow between plasmids and phages, including exchange of mobile element core functions, defense systems, and antibiotic resistance. Moreover, a combination of gene transfer and gene inactivation may result in the conversion of elements. For example, gene loss turns P1-like phage-plasmids into integrative prophages or into plasmids (that are no longer phages). Remarkably, some of the latter have acquired conjugation-related functions to became mobilisable by conjugation. Thus, our work indicates that phage-plasmids can play a key role in the transfer of genes across mobile elements within their hosts, and can act as intermediates in the conversion of one type of element into another."
145,"Multi-dimensional scaling techniques unveiled gain1q&loss13q co-occurrence in Multiple Myeloma patients with specific genomic, transcriptional and adverse clinical features","The complexity of Multiple Myeloma (MM) is driven by several genomic aberrations, interacting with disease-related and/or -unrelated factors and conditioning patients’ clinical outcome. Patient’s prognosis is hardly predictable, as commonly employed MM risk models do not precisely partition high- from low-risk patients, preventing the reliable recognition of early relapsing/refractory patients. By a dimensionality reduction approach, here we dissect the genomic landscape of a large cohort of newly diagnosed MM patients, modelling all the possible interactions between any MM chromosomal alterations. We highlight the presence of a distinguished cluster of patients in the low-dimensionality space, with unfavorable clinical behavior, whose biology was driven by the co-occurrence of chromosomes 1q CN gain and 13 CN loss. Presence or absence of these alterations define MM patients overexpressing either 
CCND2
 or 
CCND1
, fostering the implementation of biology-based patients’ classification models to describe the different MM clinical behaviors."
146,SLIDE: Significant Latent Factor Interaction Discovery and Exploration across biological domains,"Modern multiomic technologies can generate deep multiscale profiles. However, differences in data modalities, multicollinearity of the data, and large numbers of irrelevant features make analyses and integration of high-dimensional omic datasets challenging. Here we present Significant Latent Factor Interaction Discovery and Exploration (SLIDE), a first-in-class interpretable machine learning technique for identifying significant interacting latent factors underlying outcomes of interest from high-dimensional omic datasets. SLIDE makes no assumptions regarding data-generating mechanisms, comes with theoretical guarantees regarding identifiability of the latent factors/corresponding inference, and has rigorous false discovery rate control. Using SLIDE on single-cell and spatial omic datasets, we uncovered significant interacting latent factors underlying a range of molecular, cellular and organismal phenotypes. SLIDE outperforms/performs at least as well as a wide range of state-of-the-art approaches, including other latent factor approaches. More importantly, it provides biological inference beyond prediction that other methods do not afford. Thus, SLIDE is a versatile engine for biological discovery from modern multiomic datasets."
147,Machine learning-based extrachromosomal DNA identification in large-scale cohorts reveals its clinical implications in cancer,"The clinical implications of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer therapy remain largely elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of ecDNA amplification spectra and their association with clinical and molecular features in multiple cohorts comprising over 13,000 pan-cancer patients. Using our developed computational framework, GCAP, and validating it with multifaceted approaches, we reveal a consistent pan-cancer pattern of mutual exclusivity between ecDNA amplification and microsatellite instability (MSI). In addition, we establish the role of ecDNA amplification as a risk factor and refine genomic subtypes in a cohort from 1015 colorectal cancer patients. Importantly, our investigation incorporates data from four clinical trials focused on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, demonstrating the pivotal role of ecDNA amplification as a biomarker for guiding checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer. This finding represents clinical evidence linking ecDNA amplification to the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic interventions. Overall, our study provides a proof-of-concept of identifying ecDNA amplification from cancer whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, highlighting the potential of ecDNA amplification as a valuable biomarker for facilitating personalized cancer treatment."
148,"The ctenophore 
Mnemiopsis leidyi
 deploys a rapid injury response dating back to the last common animal ancestor","Regenerative potential is widespread but unevenly distributed across animals. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying regenerative processes is limited to a handful of model organisms, restricting robust comparative analyses. Here, we conduct a time course of RNA-seq during whole body regeneration in 
Mnemiopsis leidyi
 (Ctenophora) to uncover gene expression changes that correspond with key events during the regenerative timeline of this species. We identified several genes highly enriched in this dataset beginning as early as 10 minutes after surgical bisection including transcription factors in the early timepoints, peptidases in the middle timepoints, and cytoskeletal genes in the later timepoints. We validated the expression of early response transcription factors by whole mount in situ hybridization, showing that these genes exhibited high expression in tissues surrounding the wound site. These genes exhibit a pattern of transient upregulation as seen in a variety of other organisms, suggesting that they may be initiators of an ancient gene regulatory network linking wound healing to the initiation of a regenerative response."
149,"The frequency of pathogenic variation in the 
All of Us
 cohort reveals ancestry-driven disparities","Disparities in data underlying clinical genomic interpretation is an acknowledged problem, but there is a paucity of data demonstrating it. The 
All of Us
 Research Program is collecting data including whole-genome sequences, health records, and surveys for at least a million participants with diverse ancestry and access to healthcare, representing one of the largest biomedical research repositories of its kind. Here, we examine pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants that were identified in the 
All of Us
 cohort. The European ancestry subgroup showed the highest overall rate of pathogenic variation, with 2.26% of participants having a pathogenic variant. Other ancestry groups had lower rates of pathogenic variation, including 1.62% for the African ancestry group and 1.32% in the Latino/Admixed American ancestry group. Pathogenic variants were most frequently observed in genes related to Breast/Ovarian Cancer or Hypercholesterolemia. Variant frequencies in many genes were consistent with the data from the public gnomAD database, with some notable exceptions resolved using gnomAD subsets. Differences in pathogenic variant frequency observed between ancestral groups generally indicate biases of ascertainment of knowledge about those variants, but some deviations may be indicative of differences in disease prevalence. This work will allow targeted precision medicine efforts at revealed disparities."
150,Costs of ribosomal RNA stabilization affect ribosome composition at maximum growth rate,"Ribosomes are key to cellular self-fabrication and limit growth rate. While most enzymes are proteins, ribosomes consist of 1/3 protein and 2/3 ribonucleic acid (RNA) (in 
E. coli
).
Here, we develop a mechanistic model of a self-fabricating cell, validated across diverse growth conditions. Through resource balance analysis (RBA), we explore the variation in maximum growth rate with ribosome composition, assuming constant kinetic parameters.
Our model highlights the importance of RNA instability. If we neglect it, RNA synthesis is always cheaper than protein synthesis, leading to an RNA-only ribosome at maximum growth rate. Upon accounting for RNA turnover, we find that a mixed ribosome composed of RNA and proteins maximizes growth rate. To account for RNA turnover, we explore two scenarios regarding the activity of RNases. In (a) degradation is proportional to RNA content. In (b) ribosomal proteins cooperatively mitigate RNA instability by protecting it from misfolding and subsequent degradation. In both cases, higher protein content elevates protein synthesis costs and simultaneously lowers RNA turnover expenses, resulting in mixed RNA-protein ribosomes. Only scenario (b) aligns qualitatively with experimental data across varied growth conditions.
Our research provides fresh insights into ribosome biogenesis and evolution, paving the way for understanding protein-rich ribosomes in archaea and mitochondria."
151,"Common mitochondrial deletions in RNA-Seq: evaluation of bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic datasets","Common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are large structural variants in the mitochondrial genome that accumulate in metabolically active tissues with age and have been investigated in various diseases. We applied the Splice-Break2 pipeline (designed for high-throughput quantification of mtDNA deletions) to human RNA-Seq datasets and describe the methodological considerations for evaluating common deletions in bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics datasets. A robust evaluation of 1570 samples from 14 RNA-Seq studies showed: (i) the abundance of some common deletions detected in PCR-amplified mtDNA correlates with levels observed in RNA-Seq data; (ii) RNA-Seq library preparation method has a strong effect on deletion detection; (iii) deletions had a significant, positive correlation with age in brain and muscle; (iv) deletions were enriched in cortical grey matter, specifically in layers 3 and 5; and (v) brain regions with dopaminergic neurons (i.e., substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and caudate nucleus) had remarkable enrichment of common mtDNA deletions."
152,Toward universal cell embeddings: integrating single-cell RNA-seq datasets across species with SATURN,"Analysis of single-cell datasets generated from diverse organisms offers unprecedented opportunities to unravel fundamental evolutionary processes of conservation and diversification of cell types. However, interspecies genomic differences limit the joint analysis of cross-species datasets to homologous genes. Here we present SATURN, a deep learning method for learning universal cell embeddings that encodes genes’ biological properties using protein language models. By coupling protein embeddings from language models with RNA expression, SATURN integrates datasets profiled from different species regardless of their genomic similarity. SATURN can detect functionally related genes coexpressed across species, redefining differential expression for cross-species analysis. Applying SATURN to three species whole-organism atlases and frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets, we show that SATURN can effectively transfer annotations across species, even when they are evolutionarily remote. We also demonstrate that SATURN can be used to find potentially divergent gene functions between glaucoma-associated genes in humans and four other species."
153,Multiscale biochemical mapping of the brain through deep-learning-enhanced high-throughput mass spectrometry,"Spatial omics technologies can reveal the molecular intricacy of the brain. While mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides spatial localization of compounds, comprehensive biochemical profiling at a brain-wide scale in three dimensions by MSI with single-cell resolution has not been achieved. We demonstrate complementary brain-wide and single-cell biochemical mapping using MEISTER, an integrative experimental and computational mass spectrometry (MS) framework. Our framework integrates a deep-learning-based reconstruction that accelerates high-mass-resolving MS by 15-fold, multimodal registration creating three-dimensional (3D) molecular distributions and a data integration method fitting cell-specific mass spectra to 3D datasets. We imaged detailed lipid profiles in tissues with millions of pixels and in large single-cell populations acquired from the rat brain. We identified region-specific lipid contents and cell-specific localizations of lipids depending on both cell subpopulations and anatomical origins of the cells. Our workflow establishes a blueprint for future development of multiscale technologies for biochemical characterization of the brain."
154,A signal processing and deep learning framework for methylation detection using Oxford Nanopore sequencing,"Oxford Nanopore sequencing can detect DNA methylations from ionic current signal of single molecules, offering a unique advantage over conventional methods. Additionally, adaptive sampling, a software-controlled enrichment method for targeted sequencing, allows reduced representation methylation sequencing that can be applied to CpG islands or imprinted regions. Here we present DeepMod2, a comprehensive deep-learning framework for methylation detection using ionic current signal from Nanopore sequencing. DeepMod2 implements both a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model and a Transformer model and can analyze POD5 and FAST5 signal files generated on R9 and R10 flowcells. Additionally, DeepMod2 can run efficiently on central processing unit (CPU) through model pruning and can infer epihaplotypes or haplotype-specific methylation calls from phased reads. We use multiple publicly available and newly generated datasets to evaluate the performance of DeepMod2 under varying scenarios. DeepMod2 has comparable performance to Guppy and Dorado, which are the current state-of-the-art methods from Oxford Nanopore Technologies that remain closed-source. Moreover, we show a high correlation (r = 0.96) between reduced representation and whole-genome Nanopore sequencing. In summary, DeepMod2 is an open-source tool that enables fast and accurate DNA methylation detection from whole-genome or adaptive sequencing data on a diverse range of flowcell types."
155,Priority index for critical Covid-19 identifies clinically actionable targets and drugs,"While genome-wide studies have identified genomic loci in hosts associated with life-threatening Covid-19 (critical Covid-19), the challenge of resolving these loci hinders further identification of clinically actionable targets and drugs. Building upon our previous success, we here present a priority index solution designed to address this challenge, generating the target and drug resource that consists of two indexes: the target index and the drug index. The primary purpose of the target index is to identify clinically actionable targets by prioritising genes associated with Covid-19. We illustrate the validity of the target index by demonstrating its ability to identify pre-existing Covid-19 phase-III drug targets, with the majority of these targets being found at the leading prioritisation (leading targets). These leading targets have their evolutionary origins in Amniota (‘four-leg vertebrates’) and are predominantly involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and JAK-STAT signaling. The drug index highlights opportunities for repurposing clinically approved JAK-STAT inhibitors, either individually or in combination. This proposed strategic focus on the JAK-STAT pathway is supported by the active pursuit of therapeutic agents targeting this pathway in ongoing phase-II/III clinical trials for Covid-19."
156,A genome and gene catalog of the aquatic microbiomes of the Tibetan Plateau,"The Tibetan Plateau supplies water to nearly 2 billion people in Asia, but climate change poses threats to its aquatic microbial resources. Here, we construct the Tibetan Plateau Microbial Catalog by sequencing 498 metagenomes from six water ecosystems (saline lakes, freshwater lakes, rivers, hot springs, wetlands and glaciers). Our catalog expands knowledge of regional genomic diversity by presenting 32,355 metagenome-assembled genomes that de-replicated into 10,723 representative genome-based species, of which 88% were unannotated. The catalog contains nearly 300 million non-redundant gene clusters, of which 15% novel, and 73,864 biosynthetic gene clusters, of which 50% novel, thus expanding known functional diversity. Using these data, we investigate the Tibetan Plateau aquatic microbiome’s biogeography along a distance of 2,500 km and >5 km in altitude. Microbial compositional similarity and the shared gene count with the Tibetan Plateau microbiome decline along with distance and altitude difference, suggesting a dispersal pattern. The Tibetan Plateau Microbial Catalog stands as a substantial repository for high-altitude aquatic microbiome resources, providing potential for discovering novel lineages and functions, and bridging knowledge gaps in microbiome biogeography."
157,TFvelo: gene regulation inspired RNA velocity estimation,"RNA velocity is closely related with cell fate and is an important indicator for the prediction of cell states with elegant physical explanation derived from single-cell RNA-seq data. Most existing RNA velocity models aim to extract dynamics from the phase delay between unspliced and spliced mRNA for each individual gene. However, unspliced/spliced mRNA abundance may not provide sufficient signal for dynamic modeling, leading to poor fit in phase portraits. Motivated by the idea that RNA velocity could be driven by the transcriptional regulation, we propose TFvelo, which expands RNA velocity concept to various single-cell datasets without relying on splicing information, by introducing gene regulatory information. Our experiments on synthetic data and multiple scRNA-Seq datasets show that TFvelo can accurately fit genes dynamics on phase portraits, and effectively infer cell pseudo-time and trajectory from RNA abundance data. TFvelo opens a robust and accurate avenue for modeling RNA velocity for single cell data."
158,Tapioca: a platform for predicting de novo protein–protein interactions in dynamic contexts,"Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) drive cellular processes and responses to environmental cues, reflecting the cellular state. Here we develop Tapioca, an ensemble machine learning framework for studying global PPIs in dynamic contexts. Tapioca predicts de novo interactions by integrating mass spectrometry interactome data from thermal/ion denaturation or cofractionation workflows with protein properties and tissue-specific functional networks. Focusing on the thermal proximity coaggregation method, we improved the experimental workflow. Finely tuned thermal denaturation afforded increased throughput, while cell lysis optimization enhanced protein detection from different subcellular compartments. The Tapioca workflow was next leveraged to investigate viral infection dynamics. Temporal PPIs were characterized during the reactivation from latency of the oncogenic Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Together with functional assays, NUCKS was identified as a proviral hub protein, and a broader role was uncovered by integrating PPI networks from alpha- and betaherpesvirus infections. Altogether, Tapioca provides a web-accessible platform for predicting PPIs in dynamic contexts."
159,PheWAS-based clustering of Mendelian Randomisation instruments reveals distinct mechanism-specific causal effects between obesity and educational attainment,"Mendelian Randomisation (MR) estimates causal effects between risk factors and complex outcomes using genetic instruments. Pleiotropy, heritable confounders, and heterogeneous causal effects violate MR assumptions and can lead to biases. To alleviate these, we propose an approach employing a Phenome-Wide association Clustering of the MR instruments (PWC-MR) and apply this method to revisit the surprisingly large apparent causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on educational attainment (EDU): 
\(\widehat{\alpha }\)
 = −0.19 [−0.22, −0.16]. First, we cluster 324 BMI-associated genetic instruments based on their association with 407 traits in the UK Biobank, which yields six distinct groups. Subsequent cluster-specific MR reveals heterogeneous causal effect estimates on EDU. A cluster enriched for socio-economic indicators yields the largest BMI-on-EDU causal effect estimate (
\(\widehat{\alpha }\)
 = −0.49 [−0.56, −0.42]) whereas a cluster enriched for body-mass specific traits provides a more likely estimate (
\(\widehat{\alpha }\)
 = −0.09 [−0.13, −0.05]). Follow-up analyses confirms these findings: within-sibling MR (
\(\widehat{\alpha }\)
 = −0.05 [−0.09, −0.01]); MR for childhood BMI on EDU (
\(\widehat{\alpha }\)
 = −0.03 [−0.06, −0.002]); step-wise multivariable MR (
\(\widehat{\alpha }\)
 = −0.05 [−0.07, −0.02]) where socio-economic indicators are jointly modelled. Here we show how the in-depth examination of the BMI-EDU causal relationship demonstrates the utility of our PWC-MR approach in revealing distinct pleiotropic pathways and confounder mechanisms."
160,High resolution spatial profiling of kidney injury and repair using RNA hybridization-based in situ sequencing,"Emerging spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies allow for the measurement of gene expression in situ at cellular resolution. We apply direct RNA hybridization-based in situ sequencing (dRNA HybISS, Cartana part of 10xGenomics) to compare male and female healthy mouse kidneys and the male kidney injury and repair timecourse. A pre-selected panel of 200 genes is used to identify cell state dynamics patterns during injury and repair. We develop a new computational pipeline, CellScopes, for the rapid analysis, multi-omic integration and visualization of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets. The resulting dataset allows us to resolve 13 kidney cell types within distinct kidney niches, dynamic alterations in cell state over the course of injury and repair and cell-cell interactions between leukocytes and kidney parenchyma. At late timepoints after injury, C3+ leukocytes are enriched near pro-inflammatory, failed-repair proximal tubule cells. Integration of snRNA-seq dataset from the same injury and repair samples also allows us to impute the spatial localization of genes not directly measured by dRNA HybISS."
161,A deep-learning-based framework for identifying and localizing multiple abnormalities and assessing cardiomegaly in chest X-ray,"Accurate identification and localization of multiple abnormalities are crucial steps in the interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs); however, the lack of a large CXR dataset with bounding boxes severely constrains accurate localization research based on deep learning. We created a large CXR dataset named CXR-AL14, containing 165,988 CXRs and 253,844 bounding boxes. On the basis of this dataset, a deep-learning-based framework was developed to identify and localize 14 common abnormalities and calculate the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) simultaneously. The mean average precision values obtained by the model for 14 abnormalities reached 0.572-0.631 with an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of the CTR algorithm exceeded 0.95 on the held-out, multicentre and prospective test datasets. This framework shows an excellent performance, good generalization ability and strong clinical applicability, which is superior to senior radiologists and suitable for routine clinical settings."
162,"Genomic epidemiology reveals geographical clustering of multidrug-resistant 
Escherichia coli
 ST131 associated with bacteraemia in Wales","Antibiotic resistance is a significant global public health concern. Uropathogenic 
Escherichia coli
 sequence type (ST)131, a widely prevalent multidrug-resistant clone, is frequently associated with bacteraemia. This study investigates third-generation cephalosporin resistance in bloodstream infections caused by 
E. coli
 ST131. From 2013-2014 blood culture surveillance in Wales, 142

An introduction to North Wales around 2002 led to a localised cluster by 2009, depicting limited genomic diversity within North Wales. This investigation emphasises the value of genomic epidemiology, allowing the detection of genetically similar strains in local areas, enabling targeted and timely public health interventions."
163,A general computational design strategy for stabilizing viral class I fusion proteins,"Many pathogenic viruses rely on class I fusion proteins to fuse their viral membrane with the host cell membrane. To drive the fusion process, class I fusion proteins undergo an irreversible conformational change from a metastable prefusion state to an energetically more stable postfusion state. Mounting evidence underscores that antibodies targeting the prefusion conformation are the most potent, making it a compelling vaccine candidate. Here, we establish a computational design protocol that stabilizes the prefusion state while destabilizing the postfusion conformation. With this protocol, we stabilize the fusion proteins of the RSV, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, testing fewer than a handful of designs. The solved structures of these designed proteins from all three viruses evidence the atomic accuracy of our approach. Furthermore, the humoral response of the redesigned RSV F protein compares to that of the recently approved vaccine in a mouse model. While the parallel design of two conformations allows the identification of energetically sub-optimal positions for one conformation, our protocol also reveals diverse molecular strategies for stabilization. Given the clinical significance of viruses using class I fusion proteins, our algorithm can substantially contribute to vaccine development by reducing the time and resources needed to optimize these immunogens."
164,"Disentangling the link between maternal influences on birth weight and disease risk in 36,211 genotyped mother–child pairs","Epidemiological studies have robustly linked lower birth weight to later-life disease risks. These observations may reflect the adverse impact of intrauterine growth restriction on a child’s health. However, causal evidence supporting such a mechanism in humans is largely lacking. Using Mendelian Randomization and 36,211 genotyped mother-child pairs from the FinnGen study, we assessed the relationship between intrauterine growth and five common health outcomes (coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, statin use, type 2 diabetes and cancer). We proxied intrauterine growth with polygenic scores for maternal effects on birth weight and took into account the transmission of genetic variants between a mother and a child in the analyses. We find limited evidence for contribution of normal variation in maternally influenced intrauterine growth on later-life disease. Instead, we find support for genetic pleiotropy in the fetal genome linking birth weight to CHD and hypertension. Our study illustrates the opportunities that data from genotyped parent-child pairs from a population-based biobank provides for addressing causality of maternal influences."
165,TISSUE: uncertainty-calibrated prediction of single-cell spatial transcriptomics improves downstream analyses,"Whole-transcriptome spatial profiling of genes at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. To address this limitation, spatial gene expression prediction methods have been developed to infer the spatial expression of unmeasured transcripts, but the quality of these predictions can vary greatly. Here we present Transcript Imputation with Spatial Single-cell Uncertainty Estimation (TISSUE) as a general framework for estimating uncertainty for spatial gene expression predictions and providing uncertainty-aware methods for downstream inference. Leveraging conformal inference, TISSUE provides well-calibrated prediction intervals for predicted expression values across 11 benchmark datasets. Moreover, it consistently reduces the false discovery rate for differential gene expression analysis, improves clustering and visualization of predicted spatial transcriptomics and improves the performance of supervised learning models trained on predicted gene expression profiles. Applying TISSUE to a MERFISH spatial transcriptomics dataset of the adult mouse subventricular zone, we identified subtypes within the neural stem cell lineage and developed subtype-specific regional classifiers."
166,Predicting proximal tubule failed repair drivers through regularized regression analysis of single cell multiomic sequencing,"Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells have considerable intrinsic repair capacity following injury. However, a fraction of injured proximal tubule cells fails to undergo normal repair and assumes a proinflammatory and profibrotic phenotype that may promote fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. The healthy to failed repair change is marked by cell state-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic changes. Single nucleus joint RNA- and ATAC-seq sequencing offers an opportunity to study the gene regulatory networks underpinning these changes in order to identify key regulatory drivers. We develop a regularized regression approach to construct genome-wide parametric gene regulatory networks using multiomic datasets. We generate a single nucleus multiomic dataset from seven adult human kidney samples and apply our method to study drivers of a failed injury response associated with kidney disease. We demonstrate that our approach is a highly effective tool for predicting key 
cis-
 and 
trans-
regulatory elements underpinning the healthy to failed repair transition and use it to identify NFAT5 as a driver of the maladaptive proximal tubule state."
167,Regression-based Deep-Learning predicts molecular biomarkers from pathology slides,"Deep Learning (DL) can predict biomarkers from cancer histopathology. Several clinically approved applications use this technology. Most approaches, however, predict categorical labels, whereas biomarkers are often continuous measurements. We hypothesize that regression-based DL outperforms classification-based DL. Therefore, we develop and evaluate a self-supervised attention-based weakly supervised regression method that predicts continuous biomarkers directly from 11,671 images of patients across nine cancer types. We test our method for multiple clinically and biologically relevant biomarkers: homologous recombination deficiency score, a clinically used pan-cancer biomarker, as well as markers of key biological processes in the tumor microenvironment. Using regression significantly enhances the accuracy of biomarker prediction, while also improving the predictions’ correspondence to regions of known clinical relevance over classification. In a large cohort of colorectal cancer patients, regression-based prediction scores provide a higher prognostic value than classification-based scores. Our open-source regression approach offers a promising alternative for continuous biomarker analysis in computational pathology."
168,Matrin3 mediates differentiation through stabilizing chromatin loop-domain interactions and YY1 mediated enhancer-promoter interactions,"Although emerging evidence indicates that alterations in proteins within nuclear compartments elicit changes in chromosomal architecture and differentiation, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we investigate the direct role of the abundant nuclear complex protein Matrin3 (Matr3) in chromatin architecture and development in the context of myogenesis. Using an acute targeted protein degradation platform (dTAG-Matr3), we reveal the dynamics of development-related chromatin reorganization. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments revealed substantial chromatin loop rearrangements soon after Matr3 depletion. Notably, YY1 binding was detected, accompanied by the emergence of novel YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter loops, which occurred concurrently with changes in histone modifications and chromatin-level binding patterns. Changes in chromatin occupancy by Matr3 also correlated with these alterations. Overall, our results suggest that Matr3 mediates differentiation through stabilizing chromatin accessibility and chromatin loop-domain interactions, and highlight a conserved and direct role for Matr3 in maintenance of chromosomal architecture."
169,Snowprint: a predictive tool for genetic biosensor discovery,"Bioengineers increasingly rely on ligand-inducible transcription regulators for chemical-responsive control of gene expression, yet the number of regulators available is limited. Novel regulators can be mined from genomes, but an inadequate understanding of their DNA specificity complicates genetic design. Here we present Snowprint, a simple yet powerful bioinformatic tool for predicting regulator:operator interactions. Benchmarking results demonstrate that Snowprint predictions are significantly similar for >45% of experimentally validated regulator:operator pairs from organisms across nine phyla and for regulators that span five distinct structural families. We then use Snowprint to design promoters for 33 previously uncharacterized regulators sourced from diverse phylogenies, of which 28 are shown to influence gene expression and 24 produce a >20-fold dynamic range. A panel of the newly repurposed regulators are then screened for response to biomanufacturing-relevant compounds, yielding new sensors for a polyketide (olivetolic acid), terpene (geraniol), steroid (ursodiol), and alkaloid (tetrahydropapaverine) with induction ratios up to 10.7-fold. Snowprint represents a unique, protein-agnostic tool that greatly facilitates the discovery of ligand-inducible transcriptional regulators for bioengineering applications.

170,A method to estimate the contribution of rare coding variants to complex trait heritability,"It has been postulated that rare coding variants (RVs; MAF < 0.01) contribute to the “missing” heritability of complex traits. We developed a framework, the Rare variant heritability (RARity) estimator, to assess RV heritability (
h
2
RV
) without assuming a particular genetic architecture. We applied RARity to 31 complex traits in the UK Biobank (
n
 = 167,348) and showed that gene-level RV aggregation suffers from 79% (95% CI: 68-93%) loss of 
h
2
RV
. Using unaggregated variants, 27 traits had 
h
2
RV
 > 5%, with height having the highest 
h
2
RV
 at 21.9% (95% CI: 19.0-24.8%). The total heritability, including common and rare variants, recovered pedigree-based estimates for 11 traits. RARity can estimate gene-level 
h
2
RV
, enabling the assessment of gene-level characteristics and revealing 11, previously unreported, gene-phenotype relationships. Finally, we demonstrated that in silico pathogenicity prediction (variant-level) and gene-level annotations do not generally enrich for RVs that over-contribute to complex trait variance, and thus, innovative methods are needed to predict RV functionality."
171,Predicting DNA structure using a deep learning method,"Understanding the mechanisms of protein-DNA binding is critical in comprehending gene regulation. Three-dimensional DNA structure, also described as DNA shape, plays a key role in these mechanisms. In this study, we present a deep learning-based method, Deep DNAshape, that fundamentally changes the current 
k
-mer based high-throughput prediction of DNA shape features by accurately accounting for the influence of extended flanking regions, without the need for extensive molecular simulations or structural biology experiments. By using the Deep DNAshape method, DNA structural features can be predicted for any length and number of DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner, providing an understanding of the effects of flanking regions on DNA structure in a target region of a sequence. The Deep DNAshape method provides access to the influence of distant flanking regions on a region of interest. Our findings reveal that DNA shape readout mechanisms of a core target are quantitatively affected by flanking regions, including extended flanking regions, providing valuable insights into the detailed structural readout mechanisms of protein-DNA binding. Furthermore, when incorporated in machine learning models, the features generated by Deep DNAshape improve the model prediction accuracy. Collectively, Deep DNAshape can serve as versatile and powerful tool for diverse DNA structure-related studies."
172,CombFold: predicting structures of large protein assemblies using a combinatorial assembly algorithm and AlphaFold2,"Deep learning models, such as AlphaFold2 and RosettaFold, enable high-accuracy protein structure prediction. However, large protein complexes are still challenging to predict due to their size and the complexity of interactions between multiple subunits. Here we present CombFold, a combinatorial and hierarchical assembly algorithm for predicting structures of large protein complexes utilizing pairwise interactions between subunits predicted by AlphaFold2. CombFold accurately predicted (TM-score >0.7) 72% of the complexes among the top-10 predictions in two datasets of 60 large, asymmetric assemblies. Moreover, the structural coverage of predicted complexes was 20% higher compared to corresponding Protein Data Bank entries. We applied the method on complexes from Complex Portal with known stoichiometry but without known structure and obtained high-confidence predictions. CombFold supports the integration of distance restraints based on crosslinking mass spectrometry and fast enumeration of possible complex stoichiometries. CombFold’s high accuracy makes it a promising tool for expanding structural coverage beyond monomeric proteins."
173,The human middle ear in motion: 3D visualization and quantification using dynamic synchrotron-based X-ray imaging,"The characterization of the vibrations of the middle ear ossicles during sound transmission is a focal point in clinical research. However, the small size of the structures, their micrometer-scale movement, and the deep-seated position of the middle ear within the temporal bone make these types of measurements extremely challenging. In this work, dynamic synchrotron-based X-ray phase-contrast microtomography is used on acoustically stimulated intact human ears, allowing for the three-dimensional visualization of entire human eardrums and ossicular chains in motion. A post-gating algorithm is used to temporally resolve the fast micromotions at 128 Hz, coupled with a high-throughput pipeline to process the large tomographic datasets. Seven ex-vivo fresh-frozen human temporal bones in healthy conditions are studied, and the rigid body motions of the ossicles are quantitatively delineated. Clinically relevant regions of the ossicular chain are tracked in 3D, and the amplitudes of their displacement are computed for two acoustic stimuli."
174,Antiviral fibrils of self-assembled peptides with tunable compositions,"The lasting threat of viral pandemics necessitates the development of tailorable first-response antivirals with specific but adaptive architectures for treatment of novel viral infections. Here, such an antiviral platform has been developed based on a mixture of hetero-peptides self-assembled into functionalized β-sheets capable of specific multivalent binding to viral protein complexes. One domain of each hetero-peptide is designed to specifically bind to certain viral proteins, while another domain self-assembles into fibrils with epitope binding characteristics determined by the types of peptides and their molar fractions. The self-assembled fibrils maintain enhanced binding to viral protein complexes and retain high resilience to viral mutations. This method is experimentally and computationally tested using short peptides that specifically bind to Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. This platform is efficacious, inexpensive, and stable with excellent tolerability."
175,A multicenter clinical AI system study for detection and diagnosis of focal liver lesions,"Early and accurate diagnosis of focal liver lesions is crucial for effective treatment and prognosis. We developed and validated a fully automated diagnostic system named Liver Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis System (LiAIDS) based on a diverse sample of 12,610 patients from 18 hospitals, both retrospectively and prospectively. In this study, LiAIDS achieved an F1-score of 0.940 for benign and 0.692 for malignant lesions, outperforming junior radiologists (benign: 0.830-0.890, malignant: 0.230-0.360) and being on par with senior radiologists (benign: 0.920-0.950, malignant: 0.550-0.650). Furthermore, with the assistance of LiAIDS, the diagnostic accuracy of all radiologists improved. For benign and malignant lesions, junior radiologists’ F1-scores improved to 0.936-0.946 and 0.667-0.680 respectively, while seniors improved to 0.950-0.961 and 0.679-0.753. Additionally, in a triage study of 13,192 consecutive patients, LiAIDS automatically classified 76.46% of patients as low risk with a high NPV of 99.0%. The evidence suggests that LiAIDS can serve as a routine diagnostic tool and enhance the diagnostic capabilities of radiologists for liver lesions."
176,Overlay databank unlocks data-driven analyses of biomolecules for all,"Tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) are currently revolutionising many fields, yet their applications are often limited by the lack of suitable training data in programmatically accessible format. Here we propose an effective solution to make data scattered in various locations and formats accessible for data-driven and machine learning applications using the overlay databank format. To demonstrate the practical relevance of such approach, we present the NMRlipids Databank—a community-driven, open-for-all database featuring programmatic access to quality-evaluated atom-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of cellular membranes. Cellular membrane lipid composition is implicated in diseases and controls major biological functions, but membranes are difficult to study experimentally due to their intrinsic disorder and complex phase behaviour. While MD simulations have been useful in understanding membrane systems, they require significant computational resources and often suffer from inaccuracies in model parameters. Here, we demonstrate how programmable interface for flexible implementation of data-driven and machine learning applications, and rapid access to simulation data through a graphical user interface, unlock possibilities beyond current MD simulation and experimental studies to understand cellular membranes. The proposed overlay databank concept can be further applied to other biomolecules, as well as in other fields where similar barriers hinder the AI revolution."
177,"MAIVeSS: streamlined selection of antigenically matched, high-yield viruses for seasonal influenza vaccine production","Vaccines are the main pharmaceutical intervention used against the global public health threat posed by influenza viruses. Timely selection of optimal seed viruses with matched antigenicity between vaccine antigen and circulating viruses and with high yield underscore vaccine efficacy and supply, respectively. Current methods for selecting influenza seed vaccines are labor intensive and time-consuming. Here, we report the Machine-learning Assisted Influenza VaccinE Strain Selection framework, MAIVeSS, that enables streamlined selection of naturally circulating, antigenically matched, and high-yield influenza vaccine strains directly from clinical samples by using molecular signatures of antigenicity and yield to support optimal candidate vaccine virus selection. We apply our framework on publicly available sequences to select A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine candidates and experimentally confirm that these candidates have optimal antigenicity and growth in cells and eggs. Our framework can potentially reduce the optimal vaccine candidate selection time from months to days and thus facilitate timely supply of seasonal vaccines."
178,Real-time simultaneous refractive index and thickness mapping of sub-cellular biology at the diffraction limit,"Mapping the cellular refractive index (RI) is a central task for research involving the composition of microorganisms and the development of models providing automated medical screenings with accuracy beyond 95%. These models require significantly enhancing the state-of-the-art RI mapping capabilities to provide large amounts of accurate RI data at high throughput. Here, we present a machine-learning-based technique that obtains a biological specimen’s real-time RI and thickness maps from a single image acquired with a conventional color camera. This technology leverages a suitably engineered nanostructured membrane that stretches a biological analyte over its surface and absorbs transmitted light, generating complex reflection spectra from each sample point. The technique does not need pre-existing sample knowledge. It achieves 10
−4
 RI sensitivity and sub-nanometer thickness resolution on diffraction-limited spatial areas. We illustrate practical application by performing sub-cellular segmentation of HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells, obtaining complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the cellular regions with a characteristic length of 30 
μ

179,DynamicBind: predicting ligand-specific protein-ligand complex structure with a deep equivariant generative model,"While significant advances have been made in predicting static protein structures, the inherent dynamics of proteins, modulated by ligands, are crucial for understanding protein function and facilitating drug discovery. Traditional docking methods, frequently used in studying protein-ligand interactions, typically treat proteins as rigid. While molecular dynamics simulations can propose appropriate protein conformations, they’re computationally demanding due to rare transitions between biologically relevant equilibrium states. In this study, we present DynamicBind, a deep learning method that employs equivariant geometric diffusion networks to construct a smooth energy landscape, promoting efficient transitions between different equilibrium states. DynamicBind accurately recovers ligand-specific conformations from unbound protein structures without the need for holo-structures or extensive sampling. Remarkably, it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in docking and virtual screening benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that DynamicBind can accommodate a wide range of large protein conformational changes and identify cryptic pockets in unseen protein targets. As a result, DynamicBind shows potential in accelerating the development of small molecules for previously undruggable targets and expanding the horizons of computational drug discovery."
180,Protein structure generation via folding diffusion,"The ability to computationally generate novel yet physically foldable protein structures could lead to new biological discoveries and new treatments targeting yet incurable diseases. Despite recent advances in protein structure prediction, directly generating diverse, novel protein structures from neural networks remains difficult. In this work, we present a diffusion-based generative model that generates protein backbone structures via a procedure inspired by the natural folding process. We describe a protein backbone structure as a sequence of angles capturing the relative orientation of the constituent backbone atoms, and generate structures by denoising from a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Not only does this mirror how proteins natively twist into energetically favorable conformations, the inherent shift and rotational invariance of this representation crucially alleviates the need for more complex equivariant networks. We train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model with a simple transformer backbone and demonstrate that our resulting model unconditionally generates highly realistic protein structures with complexity and structural patterns akin to those of naturally-occurring proteins. As a useful resource, we release an open-source codebase and trained models for protein structure diffusion."
181,Correcting PCR amplification errors in unique molecular identifiers to generate accurate numbers of sequencing molecules,"Unique molecular identifiers are random oligonucleotide sequences that remove PCR amplification biases. However, the impact that PCR associated sequencing errors have on the accuracy of generating absolute counts of RNA molecules is underappreciated. We show that PCR errors are a source of inaccuracy in both bulk and single-cell sequencing data, and synthesizing unique molecular identifiers using homotrimeric nucleotide blocks provides an error-correcting solution that allows absolute counting of sequenced molecules."
182,Unzipped genome assemblies of polyploid root-knot nematodes reveal unusual and clade-specific telomeric repeats,"Using long-read sequencing, we assembled and unzipped the polyploid genomes of 
Meloidogyne incognita
, 
M. javanica
 and 
M. arenaria
, three of the most devastating plant-parasitic nematodes. We found the canonical nematode telomeric repeat to be missing in these and other 
Meloidogyne
 genomes. In addition, we find no evidence for the enzyme telomerase or for orthologs of 
C. elegans
 telomere-associated proteins, suggesting alternative lengthening of telomeres. Instead, analyzing our assembled genomes, we identify species-specific composite repeats enriched mostly at one extremity of contigs. These repeats are G-rich, oriented, and transcribed, similarly to canonical telomeric repeats. We confirm them as telomeric using fluorescent in situ hybridization. These repeats are mostly found at one single end of chromosomes in these species. The discovery of unusual and specific complex telomeric repeats opens a plethora of perspectives and highlights the evolutionary diversity of telomeres despite their central roles in senescence, aging, and chromosome integrity."
183,Orchestrating chromosome conformation capture analysis with Bioconductor,"Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture assays provide formidable insights into the spatial organization of genomes. However, due to the complexity of the data structure, their integration in multi-omics workflows remains challenging. We present data structures, computational methods and visualization tools available in Bioconductor to investigate Hi-C, micro-C and other 3C-related data, in R. An online book (

) further provides prospective end users with a number of workflows to process, import, analyze and visualize any type of chromosome conformation capture data."
184,"Logical design of synthetic 
cis-
regulatory DNA for genetic tracing of cell identities and state changes","Descriptive data are rapidly expanding in biomedical research. Instead, functional validation methods with sufficient complexity remain underdeveloped. Transcriptional reporters allow experimental characterization and manipulation of developmental and disease cell states, but their design lacks flexibility. Here, we report logical design of synthetic 
cis-
regulatory DNA (LSD), a computational framework leveraging phenotypic biomarkers and trans-regulatory networks as input to design reporters marking the activity of selected cellular states and pathways. LSD uses bulk or single-cell biomarkers and a reference genome or custom 
cis-
regulatory DNA datasets with user-defined boundary regions. By benchmarking validated reporters, we integrate LSD with a computational ranking of phenotypic specificity of putative 
cis-
regulatory DNA. Experimentally, LSD-designed reporters targeting a wide range of cell states are functional without minimal promoters. Applied to broadly expressed genes from human and mouse tissues, LSD generates functional housekeeper-like sLCRs compatible with size constraints of AAV vectors for gene therapy applications. A mesenchymal glioblastoma reporter designed by LSD outperforms previously validated ones and canonical cell surface markers. In genome-scale CRISPRa screens, LSD facilitates the discovery of known and novel bona fide cell-state drivers. Thus, LSD captures core principles of 
cis-
regulation and is broadly applicable to studying complex cell states and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation."
185,The impacts of active and self-supervised learning on efficient annotation of single-cell expression data,"A crucial step in the analysis of single-cell data is annotating cells to cell types and states. While a myriad of approaches has been proposed, manual labeling of cells to create training datasets remains tedious and time-consuming. In the field of machine learning, active and self-supervised learning methods have been proposed to improve the performance of a classifier while reducing both annotation time and label budget. However, the benefits of such strategies for single-cell annotation have yet to be evaluated in realistic settings. Here, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking of active and self-supervised labeling strategies across a range of single-cell technologies and cell type annotation algorithms. We quantify the benefits of active learning and self-supervised strategies in the presence of cell type imbalance and variable similarity. We introduce adaptive reweighting, a heuristic procedure tailored to single-cell data—including a marker-aware version—that shows competitive performance with existing approaches. In addition, we demonstrate that having prior knowledge of cell type markers improves annotation accuracy. Finally, we summarize our findings into a set of recommendations for those implementing cell type annotation procedures or platforms. An R package implementing the heuristic approaches introduced in this work may be found at

186,Orientation-invariant autoencoders learn robust representations for shape profiling of cells and organelles,"Cell and organelle shape are driven by diverse genetic and environmental factors and thus accurate quantification of cellular morphology is essential to experimental cell biology. Autoencoders are a popular tool for unsupervised biological image analysis because they learn a low-dimensional representation that maps images to feature vectors to generate a semantically meaningful 
embedding space
 of morphological variation. The learned feature vectors can also be used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, and supervised learning problems. Shape properties do not change with orientation, and thus we argue that representation learning methods should encode this orientation invariance. We show that conventional autoencoders are sensitive to orientation, which can lead to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. To address this, we develop O2-variational autoencoder (O2-VAE), an unsupervised method that learns robust, orientation-invariant representations. We use O2-VAE to discover morphology subgroups in segmented cells and mitochondria, detect outlier cells, and rapidly characterise cellular shape and texture in large datasets, including in a newly generated synthetic benchmark."
187,Improving polygenic risk prediction in admixed populations by explicitly modeling ancestral-differential effects via GAUDI,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown successes in clinics, but most PRS methods focus only on participants with distinct primary continental ancestry without accommodating recently-admixed individuals with mosaic continental ancestry backgrounds for different segments of their genomes. Here, we develop GAUDI, a novel penalized-regression-based method specifically designed for admixed individuals. GAUDI explicitly models ancestry-differential effects while borrowing information across segments with shared ancestry in admixed genomes. We demonstrate marked advantages of GAUDI over other methods through comprehensive simulation and real data analyses for traits with associated variants exhibiting ancestral-differential effects. Leveraging data from the Women’s Health Initiative study, we show that GAUDI improves PRS prediction of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein in African Americans by > 64% compared to alternative methods, and even outperforms PRS-CSx with large European GWAS for some scenarios. We believe GAUDI will be a valuable tool to mitigate disparities in PRS performance in admixed individuals."
188,Tigerfish designs oligonucleotide-based in situ hybridization probes targeting intervals of highly repetitive DNA at the scale of genomes,"Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method for the targeted visualization of nucleic acids in their native contexts. Recent technological advances have leveraged computationally designed oligonucleotide (oligo) probes to interrogate > 100 distinct targets in the same sample, pushing the boundaries of FISH-based assays. However, even in the most highly multiplexed experiments, repetitive DNA regions are typically not included as targets, as the computational design of specific probes against such regions presents significant technical challenges. Consequently, many open questions remain about the organization and function of highly repetitive sequences. Here, we introduce Tigerfish, a software tool for the genome-scale design of oligo probes against repetitive DNA intervals. We showcase Tigerfish by designing a panel of 24 interval-specific repeat probes specific to each of the 24 human chromosomes and imaging this panel on metaphase spreads and in interphase nuclei. Tigerfish extends the powerful toolkit of oligo-based FISH to highly repetitive DNA."
189,Detection of senescence using machine learning algorithms based on nuclear features,"Cellular senescence is a stress response with broad pathophysiological implications. Senotherapies can induce senescence to treat cancer or eliminate senescent cells to ameliorate ageing and age-related pathologies. However, the success of senotherapies is limited by the lack of reliable ways to identify senescence. Here, we use nuclear morphology features of senescent cells to devise machine-learning classifiers that accurately predict senescence induced by diverse stressors in different cell types and tissues. As a proof-of-principle, we use these senescence classifiers to characterise senolytics and to screen for drugs that selectively induce senescence in cancer cells but not normal cells. Moreover, a tissue senescence score served to assess the efficacy of senolytic drugs and identified senescence in mouse models of liver cancer initiation, ageing, and fibrosis, and in patients with fatty liver disease. Thus, senescence classifiers can help to detect pathophysiological senescence and to discover and validate potential senotherapies."
190,Local structural preferences in shaping tau amyloid polymorphism,"Tauopathies encompass a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterised by diverse tau amyloid fibril structures. The persistence of polymorphism across tauopathies suggests that distinct pathological conditions dictate the adopted polymorph for each disease. However, the extent to which intrinsic structural tendencies of tau amyloid cores contribute to fibril polymorphism remains uncertain. Using a combination of experimental approaches, we here identify a new amyloidogenic motif, PAM4 (Polymorphic Amyloid Motif of Repeat 4), as a significant contributor to tau polymorphism. Calculation of per-residue contributions to the stability of the fibril cores of different pathologic tau structures suggests that PAM4 plays a central role in preserving structural integrity across amyloid polymorphs. Consistent with this, cryo-EM structural analysis of fibrils formed from a synthetic PAM4 peptide shows that the sequence adopts alternative structures that closely correspond to distinct disease-associated tau strains. Furthermore, in-cell experiments revealed that PAM4 deletion hampers the cellular seeding efficiency of tau aggregates extracted from Alzheimer’s disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy patients, underscoring PAM4’s pivotal role in these tauopathies. Together, our results highlight the importance of the intrinsic structural propensity of amyloid core segments to determine the structure of tau in cells, and in propagating amyloid structures in disease."
191,A sequence-aware merger of genomic structural variations at population scale,"Merging structural variations (SVs) at the population level presents a significant challenge, yet it is essential for conducting comprehensive genotypic analyses, especially in the era of pangenomics. Here, we introduce PanPop, a tool that utilizes an advanced sequence-aware SV merging algorithm to efficiently merge SVs of various types. We demonstrate that PanPop can merge and optimize the majority of multiallelic SVs into informative biallelic variants. We show its superior precision and lower rates of missing data compared to alternative software solutions. Our approach not only enables the filtering of SVs by leveraging multiple SV callers for enhanced accuracy but also facilitates the accurate merging of large-scale population SVs. These capabilities of PanPop will help to accelerate future SV-related studies."
192,Macroscale intrinsic dynamics are associated with microcircuit function in focal and generalized epilepsies,"Epilepsies are a group of neurological disorders characterized by abnormal spontaneous brain activity, involving multiscale changes in brain functional organizations. However, it is not clear to what extent the epilepsy-related perturbations of spontaneous brain activity affect macroscale intrinsic dynamics and microcircuit organizations, that supports their pathological relevance. We collect a sample of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and genetic generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), as well as healthy controls. We extract massive temporal features of fMRI BOLD time-series to characterize macroscale intrinsic dynamics, and simulate microcircuit neuronal dynamics used a large-scale biological model. Here we show whether macroscale intrinsic dynamics and microcircuit dysfunction are differed in epilepsies, and how these changes are linked. Differences in macroscale gradient of time-series features are prominent in the primary network and default mode network in TLE and GTCS. Biophysical simulations indicate reduced recurrent connection within somatomotor microcircuits in both subtypes, and even more reduced in GTCS. We further demonstrate strong spatial correlations between differences in the gradient of macroscale intrinsic dynamics and microcircuit dysfunction in epilepsies. These results emphasize the impact of abnormal neuronal activity on primary network and high-order networks, suggesting a systematic abnormality of brain hierarchical organization."
193,Congenital heart disease detection by pediatric electrocardiogram based deep learning integrated with human concepts,"Early detection is critical to achieving improved treatment outcomes for child patients with congenital heart diseases (CHDs). Therefore, developing effective CHD detection techniques using low-cost and non-invasive pediatric electrocardiogram are highly desirable. We propose a deep learning approach for CHD detection, CHDdECG, which automatically extracts features from pediatric electrocardiogram and wavelet transformation characteristics, and integrates them with key human-concept features. Developed on 65,869 cases, CHDdECG achieved ROC-AUC of 0.915 and specificity of 0.881 on a real-world test set covering 12,000 cases. Additionally, on two external test sets with 7137 and 8121 cases, the overall ROC-AUC were 0.917 and 0.907 while specificities were 0.937 and 0.907. Notably, CHDdECG surpassed cardiologists in CHD detection performance comparison, and feature importance scores suggested greater influence of automatically extracted electrocardiogram features on CHD detection compared with human-concept features, implying that CHDdECG may grasp some knowledge beyond human cognition. Our study directly impacts CHD detection with pediatric electrocardiogram and demonstrates the potential of pediatric electrocardiogram for broader benefits."
194,Direct prediction of intrinsically disordered protein conformational properties from sequence,"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous across all domains of life and play a range of functional roles. While folded domains are generally well described by a stable three-dimensional structure, IDRs exist in a collection of interconverting states known as an ensemble. This structural heterogeneity means that IDRs are largely absent from the Protein Data Bank, contributing to a lack of computational approaches to predict ensemble conformational properties from sequence. Here we combine rational sequence design, large-scale molecular simulations and deep learning to develop ALBATROSS, a deep-learning model for predicting ensemble dimensions of IDRs, including the radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, polymer-scaling exponent and ensemble asphericity, directly from sequences at a proteome-wide scale. ALBATROSS is lightweight, easy to use and accessible as both a locally installable software package and a point-and-click-style interface via Google Colab notebooks. We first demonstrate the applicability of our predictors by examining the generalizability of sequence–ensemble relationships in IDRs. Then, we leverage the high-throughput nature of ALBATROSS to characterize the sequence-specific biophysical behavior of IDRs within and between proteomes."
195,DeepFocus: fast focus and astigmatism correction for electron microscopy,"High-throughput 2D and 3D scanning electron microscopy, which relies on automation and dependable control algorithms, requires high image quality with minimal human intervention. Classical focus and astigmatism correction algorithms attempt to explicitly model image formation and subsequently aberration correction. Such models often require parameter adjustments by experts when deployed to new microscopes, challenging samples, or imaging conditions to prevent unstable convergence, making them hard to use in practice or unreliable. Here, we introduce DeepFocus, a purely data-driven method for aberration correction in scanning electron microscopy. DeepFocus works under very low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, reduces processing times by more than an order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art method, rapidly converges within a large aberration range, and is easily recalibrated to different microscopes or challenging samples."
196,ContScout: sensitive detection and removal of contamination from annotated genomes,"Contamination of genomes is an increasingly recognized problem affecting several downstream applications, from comparative evolutionary genomics to metagenomics. Here we introduce ContScout, a precise tool for eliminating foreign sequences from annotated genomes. It achieves high specificity and sensitivity on synthetic benchmark data even when the contaminant is a closely related species, outperforms competing tools, and can distinguish horizontal gene transfer from contamination. A screen of 844 eukaryotic genomes for contamination identified bacteria as the most common source, followed by fungi and plants. Furthermore, we show that contaminants in ancestral genome reconstructions lead to erroneous early origins of genes and inflate gene loss rates, leading to a false notion of complex ancestral genomes. Taken together, we offer here a tool for sensitive removal of foreign proteins, identify and remove contaminants from diverse eukaryotic genomes and evaluate their impact on phylogenomic analyses."
197,Effect of aging on the human myometrium at single-cell resolution,"Age-associated myometrial dysfunction can prompt complications during pregnancy and labor, which is one of the factors contributing to the 7.8-fold increase in maternal mortality in women over 40. Using single-cell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we have constructed a cellular atlas of the aging myometrium from 186,120 cells across twenty perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. We identify 23 myometrial cell subpopulations, including contractile and venous capillary cells as well as immune-modulated fibroblasts. Myometrial aging leads to fewer contractile capillary cells, a reduced level of ion channel expression in smooth muscle cells, and impaired gene expression in endothelial, smooth muscle, fibroblast, perivascular, and immune cells. We observe altered myometrial cell-to-cell communication as an aging hallmark, which associated with the loss of 25 signaling pathways, including those related to angiogenesis, tissue repair, contractility, immunity, and nervous system regulation. These insights may contribute to a better understanding of the complications faced by older individuals during pregnancy and labor."
198,scDisInFact: disentangled learning for integration and prediction of multi-batch multi-condition single-cell RNA-sequencing data,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used for disease studies, where sample batches are collected from donors under different conditions including demographic groups, disease stages, and drug treatments. It is worth noting that the differences among sample batches in such a study are a mixture of technical confounders caused by batch effect and biological variations caused by condition effect. However, current batch effect removal methods often eliminate both technical batch effect and meaningful condition effect, while perturbation prediction methods solely focus on condition effect, resulting in inaccurate gene expression predictions due to unaccounted batch effect. Here we introduce scDisInFact, a deep learning framework that models both batch effect and condition effect in scRNA-seq data. scDisInFact learns latent factors that disentangle condition effect from batch effect, enabling it to simultaneously perform three tasks: batch effect removal, condition-associated key gene detection, and perturbation prediction. We evaluate scDisInFact on both simulated and real datasets, and compare its performance with baseline methods for each task. Our results demonstrate that scDisInFact outperforms existing methods that focus on individual tasks, providing a more comprehensive and accurate approach for integrating and predicting multi-batch multi-condition single-cell RNA-sequencing data."
199,"Longitudinal quantification of 
Bifidobacterium longum
 subsp. 
infantis
 reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition","Breast milk contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that cannot be digested by infants, yet nourish their developing gut microbiome. While 
Bifidobacterium
 are the best-known utilizers of individual HMOs, a longitudinal study examining the evolving microbial community at high-resolution coupled with mothers’ milk HMO composition is lacking. Here, we developed a high-throughput method to quantify 
Bifidobacterium longum
 subsp. 
infantis (BL. infantis)
, a proficient HMO-utilizer, and applied it to a longitudinal cohort consisting of 21 mother-infant dyads. We observed substantial changes in the infant gut microbiome over the course of several months, while the HMO composition in mothers’ milk remained relatively stable. Although 
Bifidobacterium
 species significantly influenced sample variation, no specific HMOs correlated with 
Bifidobacterium
 species abundance. Surprisingly, we found that 
BL. infantis
 colonization began late in the breastfeeding period both in our cohort and in other geographic locations, highlighting the importance of focusing on 
BL. infantis
 dynamics in the infant gut."
200,Single-cell analysis of psoriasis resolution demonstrates an inflammatory fibroblast state targeted by IL-23 blockade,"Biologic therapies targeting the IL-23/IL-17 axis have transformed the treatment of psoriasis. However, the early mechanisms of action of these drugs remain poorly understood. Here, we perform longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing in affected individuals receiving IL-23 inhibitor therapy. By profiling skin at baseline, day 3 and day 14 of treatment, we demonstrate that IL-23 blockade causes marked gene expression shifts, with fibroblast and myeloid populations displaying the most extensive changes at day 3. We also identify a transient 
WNT5A
+
/IL24+
 fibroblast state, which is only detectable in lesional skin. 
In-silico
 and in-vitro studies indicate that signals stemming from these 
WNT5A
+
/IL24+
 fibroblasts upregulate multiple inflammatory genes in keratinocytes. Importantly, the abundance of 
WNT5A
+
/IL24+
 fibroblasts is significantly reduced after treatment. This observation is validated 
in-silico
, by deconvolution of multiple transcriptomic datasets, and experimentally, by RNA in-situ hybridization. These findings demonstrate that the evolution of inflammatory fibroblast states is a key feature of resolving psoriasis skin."
201,Semi-supervised integration of single-cell transcriptomics data,"Batch effects in single-cell RNA-seq data pose a significant challenge for comparative analyses across samples, individuals, and conditions. Although batch effect correction methods are routinely applied, data integration often leads to overcorrection and can result in the loss of biological variability. In this work we present STACAS, a batch correction method for scRNA-seq that leverages prior knowledge on cell types to preserve biological variability upon integration. Through an open-source benchmark, we show that semi-supervised STACAS outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, as well as supervised methods such as scANVI and scGen. STACAS scales well to large datasets and is robust to incomplete and imprecise input cell type labels, which are commonly encountered in real-life integration tasks. We argue that the incorporation of prior cell type information should be a common practice in single-cell data integration, and we provide a flexible framework for semi-supervised batch effect correction."
202,Utility of long-read sequencing for All of Us,"The All of Us (AoU) initiative aims to sequence the genomes of over one million Americans from diverse ethnic backgrounds to improve personalized medical care. In a recent technical pilot, we compare the performance of traditional short-read sequencing with long-read sequencing in a small cohort of samples from the HapMap project and two AoU control samples representing eight datasets. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in the ability of these technologies to accurately sequence complex medically relevant genes, particularly in terms of gene coverage and pathogenic variant identification. We also consider the advantages and challenges of using low coverage sequencing to increase sample numbers in large cohort analysis. Our results show that HiFi reads produce the most accurate results for both small and large variants. Further, we present a cloud-based pipeline to optimize SNV, indel and SV calling at scale for long-reads analysis. These results lead to widespread improvements across AoU."
203,Single-cell multiomics decodes regulatory programs for mouse secondary palate development,"Perturbations in gene regulation during palatogenesis can lead to cleft palate, which is among the most common congenital birth defects. Here, we perform single-cell multiome sequencing and profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression simultaneously within the same cells (
n
 = 36,154) isolated from mouse secondary palate across embryonic days (E) 12.5, E13.5, E14.0, and E14.5. We construct five trajectories representing continuous differentiation of cranial neural crest-derived multipotent cells into distinct lineages. By linking open chromatin signals to gene expression changes, we characterize the underlying lineage-determining transcription factors. In silico perturbation analysis identifies transcription factors SHOX2 and MEOX2 as important regulators of the development of the anterior and posterior palate, respectively. In conclusion, our study charts epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics in palatogenesis, serving as a valuable resource for further cleft palate research."
204,Trajectory inference across multiple conditions with condiments,"In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), gene expression is assessed individually for each cell, allowing the investigation of developmental processes, such as embryogenesis and cellular differentiation and regeneration, at unprecedented resolution. In such dynamic biological systems, cellular states form a continuum, e.g., for the differentiation of stem cells into mature cell types. This process is often represented via a trajectory in a reduced-dimensional representation of the scRNA-Seq dataset. While many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference, it is often unclear how to handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g., inferring and comparing the differentiation trajectories of wild-type and knock-out stem cell populations. In this manuscript, we present 
condiments
, a method for the inference and downstream interpretation of cell trajectories across multiple conditions. Our framework allows the interpretation of differences between conditions at the trajectory, cell population, and gene expression levels. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the cell’s conditions along the trajectory’s path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression or fate selection. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path."
205,scPerturb: harmonized single-cell perturbation data,"Analysis across a growing number of single-cell perturbation datasets is hampered by poor data interoperability. To facilitate development and benchmarking of computational methods, we collect a set of 44 publicly available single-cell perturbation–response datasets with molecular readouts, including transcriptomics, proteomics and epigenomics. We apply uniform quality control pipelines and harmonize feature annotations. The resulting information resource, scPerturb, enables development and testing of computational methods, and facilitates comparison and integration across datasets. We describe energy statistics (E-statistics) for quantification of perturbation effects and significance testing, and demonstrate E-distance as a general distance measure between sets of single-cell expression profiles. We illustrate the application of E-statistics for quantifying similarity and efficacy of perturbations. The perturbation–response datasets and E-statistics computation software are publicly available at scperturb.org. This work provides an information resource for researchers working with single-cell perturbation data and recommendations for experimental design, including optimal cell counts and read depth."
206,SiFT: uncovering hidden biological processes by probabilistic filtering of single-cell data,"Cellular populations simultaneously encode multiple biological attributes, including spatial configuration, temporal trajectories, and cell-cell interactions. Some of these signals may be overshadowed by others and harder to recover, despite the great progress made to computationally reconstruct biological processes from single-cell data. To address this, we present SiFT, a kernel-based projection method for filtering biological signals in single-cell data, thus uncovering underlying biological processes. SiFT applies to a wide range of tasks, from the removal of unwanted variation in the data to revealing hidden biological structures. We demonstrate how SiFT enhances the liver circadian signal by filtering spatial zonation, recovers regenerative cell subpopulations in spatially-resolved liver data, and exposes COVID-19 disease-related cells, pathways, and dynamics by filtering healthy reference signals. SiFT performs the correction at the gene expression level, can scale to large datasets, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods."
207,"Single-cell transcriptome analysis of epithelial, immune, and stromal signatures and interactions in human ovarian cancer","A comprehensive investigation of ovarian cancer (OC) progression at the single-cell level is crucial for enhancing our understanding of the disease, as well as for the development of better diagnoses and treatments. Here, over half a million single-cell transcriptome data were collected from 84 OC patients across all clinical stages. Through integrative analysis, we identified heterogeneous epithelial-immune-stromal cellular compartments and their interactions in the OC microenvironment. The epithelial cells displayed clinical subtype features with functional variance. A significant increase in distinct T cell subtypes was identified including Tregs and CD8+ exhausted T cells from stage IC2. Additionally, we discovered antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) exhibiting enriched extracellular matrix (ECM) functionality linked to tumor progression at stage IC2. Furthermore, the NECTIN2-TIGIT ligand-receptor pair was identified to mediate T cells communicating with epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, and other cell types. Knock-out of 
NECTIN2
 using CRISPR/Cas9 inhibited ovarian cancer cell (SKOV3) proliferation, and increased T cell proliferation when co-cultured. These findings shed light on the cellular compartments and functional aspects of OC, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying stage IC2 and potential therapeutic strategies for OC."
208,Compositional and temporal division of labor modulates mixed sugar fermentation by an engineered yeast consortium,"Synthetic microbial communities have emerged as an attractive route for chemical bioprocessing. They are argued to be superior to single strains through microbial division of labor (DOL), but the exact mechanism by which DOL confers advantages remains unclear. Here, we utilize a synthetic 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 consortium along with mathematical modeling to achieve tunable mixed sugar fermentation to overcome the limitations of single-strain fermentation. The consortium involves two strains with each specializing in glucose or xylose utilization for ethanol production. By controlling initial community composition, DOL allows fine tuning of fermentation dynamics and product generation. By altering inoculation delay, DOL provides additional programmability to parallelly regulate fermentation characteristics and product yield. Mathematical models capture observed experimental findings and further offer guidance for subsequent fermentation optimization. This study demonstrates the functional potential of DOL in bioprocessing and provides insight into the rational design of engineered ecosystems for various applications."
209,Anti-correlated feature selection prevents false discovery of subpopulations in scRNAseq,"While sub-clustering cell-populations has become popular in single cell-omics, negative controls for this process are lacking. Popular feature-selection/clustering algorithms fail the null-dataset problem, allowing erroneous subdivisions of homogenous clusters until nearly each cell is called its own cluster. Using real and synthetic datasets, we find that anti-correlated gene selection reduces or eliminates erroneous subdivisions, increases marker-gene selection efficacy, and efficiently scales to millions of cells."
210,Emergence of periodic circumferential actin cables from the anisotropic fusion of actin nanoclusters during tubulogenesis,"The periodic circumferential cytoskeleton supports various tubular tissues. Radial expansion of the tube lumen causes anisotropic tensile stress, which can be exploited as a geometric cue. However, the molecular machinery linking anisotropy to robust circumferential patterning is poorly understood. Here, we aim to reveal the emergent process of circumferential actin cable formation in a 
Drosophila
 tracheal tube. During luminal expansion, sporadic actin nanoclusters emerge and exhibit circumferentially biased motion and fusion. RNAi screening reveals the formin family protein, DAAM, as an essential component responding to tissue anisotropy, and non-muscle myosin II as a component required for nanocluster fusion. An agent-based model simulation suggests that crosslinkers play a crucial role in nanocluster formation and cluster-to-cable transition occurs in response to mechanical anisotropy. Altogether, we propose that an actin nanocluster is an organizational unit that responds to stress in the cortical membrane and builds a higher-order cable structure."
211,Rational strain design with minimal phenotype perturbation,"Devising genetic interventions for desired cellular phenotypes remains challenging regarding time and resources. Kinetic models can accelerate this task by simulating metabolic responses to genetic perturbations. However, exhaustive design evaluations with kinetic models are computationally impractical, especially when targeting multiple enzymes. Here, we introduce a framework for efficiently scouting the design space while respecting cellular physiological requirements. The framework employs mixed-integer linear programming and nonlinear simulations with large-scale nonlinear kinetic models to devise genetic interventions while accounting for the network effects of these perturbations. Importantly, it ensures the engineered strain’s robustness by maintaining its phenotype close to that of the reference strain. The framework, applied to improve the anthranilate production in 
E. coli
, devises designs for experimental implementation, including eight previously experimentally validated targets. We expect this framework to play a crucial role in future design-build-test-learn cycles, significantly expediting the strain design compared to exhaustive design enumeration."
212,Human whole-exome genotype data for Alzheimer’s disease,"The heterogeneity of the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data generation methods present a challenge to a joint analysis. Here we present a bioinformatics strategy for joint-calling 20,504 WES samples collected across nine studies and sequenced using ten capture kits in fourteen sequencing centers in the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project. The joint-genotype called variant-called format (VCF) file contains only positions within the union of capture kits. The VCF was then processed specifically to account for the batch effects arising from the use of different capture kits from different studies. We identified 8.2 million autosomal variants. 96.82% of the variants are high-quality, and are located in 28,579 Ensembl transcripts. 41% of the variants are intronic and 1.8% of the variants are with CADD > 30, indicating they are of high predicted pathogenicity. Here we show our new strategy can generate high-quality data from processing these diversely generated WES samples. The improved ability to combine data sequenced in different batches benefits the whole genomics research community."
213,Ultraconserved bacteriophage genome sequence identified in 1300-year-old human palaeofaeces,"Bacteriophages are widely recognised as rapidly evolving biological entities. However, knowledge about ancient bacteriophages is limited. Here, we analyse DNA sequence datasets previously generated from ancient palaeofaeces and human gut-content samples, and identify an ancient phage genome nearly identical to present-day 
Mushuvirus mushu
, a virus that infects gut commensal bacteria. The DNA damage patterns of the genome are consistent with its ancient origin and, despite 1300 years of evolution, the ancient 
Mushuvirus
 genome shares 97.7% nucleotide identity with its modern counterpart, indicating a long-term relationship between the prophage and its host. In addition, we reconstruct and authenticate 297 other phage genomes from the last 5300 years, including those belonging to unknown families. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing ancient phage genome sequences, thus expanding the known virosphere and offering insights into phage-bacteria interactions spanning several millennia."
214,MARS an improved de novo peptide candidate selection method for non-canonical antigen target discovery in cancer,"Understanding the nature and extent of non-canonical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presentation in tumour cells is a priority for target antigen discovery for the development of next generation immunotherapies in cancer. We here employ a de novo mass spectrometric sequencing approach with a refined, MHC-centric analysis strategy to detect non-canonical MHC-associated peptides specific to cancer without any prior knowledge of the target sequence from genomic or RNA sequencing data. Our strategy integrates 
M
HC binding rank, 
A
verage local confidence scores, and peptide 
R
etention time prediction for improved de novo candidate 
S
election; culminating in the machine learning model MARS. We benchmark our model on a large synthetic peptide library dataset and reanalysis of a published dataset of high-quality non-canonical MHC-associated peptide identifications in human cancer. We achieve almost 2-fold improvement for high quality spectral assignments in comparison to de novo sequencing alone with an estimated accuracy of above 85.7% when integrated with a stepwise peptide sequence mapping strategy. Finally, we utilize MARS to detect and validate lncRNA-derived peptides in human cervical tumour resections, demonstrating its suitability to discover novel, immunogenic, non-canonical peptide sequences in primary tumour tissue."
215,Segment anything in medical images,"Medical image segmentation is a critical component in clinical practice, facilitating accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, existing methods, often tailored to specific modalities or disease types, lack generalizability across the diverse spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks. Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed for bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The model is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263 image-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than modality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient segmentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization of treatment plans."
216,Molecular quantitative trait loci in reproductive tissues impact male fertility in cattle,"Breeding bulls are well suited to investigate inherited variation in male fertility because they are genotyped and their reproductive success is monitored through semen analyses and thousands of artificial inseminations. However, functional data from relevant tissues are lacking in cattle, which prevents fine-mapping fertility-associated genomic regions. Here, we characterize gene expression and splicing variation in testis, epididymis, and vas deferens transcriptomes of 118 mature bulls and conduct association tests between 414,667 molecular phenotypes and 21,501,032 genome-wide variants to identify 41,156 regulatory loci. We show broad consensus in tissue-specific and tissue-enriched gene expression between the three bovine tissues and their human and murine counterparts. Expression- and splicing-mediating variants are more than three times as frequent in testis than epididymis and vas deferens, highlighting the transcriptional complexity of testis. Finally, we identify genes (
WDR19
, 
SPATA16
, 
KCTD19
, 
ZDHHC1
) and molecular phenotypes that are associated with quantitative variation in male fertility through transcriptome-wide association and colocalization analyses."
217,Using big sequencing data to identify chronic SARS-Coronavirus-2 infections,"The evolution of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been characterized by the periodic emergence of highly divergent variants. One leading hypothesis suggests these variants may have emerged during chronic infections of immunocompromised individuals, but limited data from these cases hinders comprehensive analyses. Here, we harnessed millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify potential chronic infections and used language models (LM) to infer chronic-associated mutations. First, we mined the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and identified chronic-like clades with identical metadata (location, age, and sex) spanning over 21 days, suggesting a prolonged infection. We inferred 271 chronic-like clades, which exhibited characteristics similar to confirmed chronic infections. Chronic-associated mutations were often high-fitness immune-evasive mutations located in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), yet a minority were unique to chronic infections and absent in global settings. The probability of observing high-fitness RBD mutations was 10-20 times higher in chronic infections than in global transmission chains. The majority of RBD mutations in BA.1/BA.2 chronic-like clades bore predictive value, i.e., went on to display global success. Finally, we used our LM to infer hundreds of additional chronic-like clades in the absence of metadata. Our approach allows mining extensive sequencing data and providing insights into future evolutionary patterns of SARS-CoV-2."
218,Shifting patterns of dengue three years after Zika virus emergence in Brazil,"In 2015, the Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in Brazil, leading to widespread outbreaks in Latin America. Following this, many countries in these regions reported a significant drop in the circulation of dengue virus (DENV), which resurged in 2018-2019. We examine age-specific incidence data to investigate changes in DENV epidemiology before and after the emergence of ZIKV. We observe that incidence of DENV was concentrated in younger individuals during resurgence compared to 2013-2015. This trend was more pronounced in Brazilian states that had experienced larger ZIKV outbreaks. Using a mathematical model, we show that ZIKV-induced cross-protection alone, often invoked to explain DENV decline across Latin America, cannot explain the observed age-shift without also assuming some form of disease enhancement. Our results suggest that a sudden accumulation of population-level immunity to ZIKV could suppress DENV and reduce the mean age of DENV incidence via both protective and disease-enhancing interactions."
219,Structure-guided discovery of anti-CRISPR and anti-phage defense proteins,"Bacteria use a variety of defense systems to protect themselves from phage infection. In turn, phages have evolved diverse counter-defense measures to overcome host defenses. Here, we use protein structural similarity and gene co-occurrence analyses to screen >66 million viral protein sequences and >330,000 metagenome-assembled genomes for the identification of anti-phage and counter-defense systems. We predict structures for ~300,000 proteins and perform large-scale, pairwise comparison to known anti-CRISPR (Acr) and anti-phage proteins to identify structural homologs that otherwise may not be uncovered using primary sequence search. This way, we identify a 
Bacteroidota
 phage Acr protein that inhibits Cas12a, and an 
Akkermansia muciniphila
 anti-phage defense protein, termed BxaP. Gene 
bxaP
 is found in loci encoding Bacteriophage Exclusion (BREX) and restriction-modification defense systems, but confers immunity independently. Our work highlights the advantage of combining protein structural features and gene co-localization information in studying host-phage interactions."
220,Distinguishing examples while building concepts in hippocampal and artificial networks,"The hippocampal subfield CA3 is thought to function as an auto-associative network that stores experiences as memories. Information from these experiences arrives directly from the entorhinal cortex as well as indirectly through the dentate gyrus, which performs sparsification and decorrelation. The computational purpose for these dual input pathways has not been firmly established. We model CA3 as a Hopfield-like network that stores both dense, correlated encodings and sparse, decorrelated encodings. As more memories are stored, the former merge along shared features while the latter remain distinct. We verify our model’s prediction in rat CA3 place cells, which exhibit more distinct tuning during theta phases with sparser activity. Finally, we find that neural networks trained in multitask learning benefit from a loss term that promotes both correlated and decorrelated representations. Thus, the complementary encodings we have found in CA3 can provide broad computational advantages for solving complex tasks."
221,PROST: quantitative identification of spatially variable genes and domain detection in spatial transcriptomics,"Computational methods have been proposed to leverage spatially resolved transcriptomic data, pinpointing genes with spatial expression patterns and delineating tissue domains. However, existing approaches fall short in uniformly quantifying spatially variable genes (SVGs). Moreover, from a methodological viewpoint, while SVGs are naturally associated with depicting spatial domains, they are technically dissociated in most methods. Here, we present a framework (PROST) for the quantitative recognition of spatial transcriptomic patterns, consisting of (i) quantitatively characterizing spatial variations in gene expression patterns through the PROST Index; and (ii) unsupervised clustering of spatial domains via a self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that PROST performs superior SVG identification and domain segmentation with various spatial resolutions, from multicellular to cellular levels. Importantly, PROST Index can be applied to prioritize spatial expression variations, facilitating the exploration of biological insights. Together, our study provides a flexible and robust framework for analyzing diverse spatial transcriptomic data."
222,Content-aware frame interpolation (CAFI): deep learning-based temporal super-resolution for fast bioimaging,"The development of high-resolution microscopes has made it possible to investigate cellular processes in 3D and over time. However, observing fast cellular dynamics remains challenging because of photobleaching and phototoxicity. Here we report the implementation of two content-aware frame interpolation (CAFI) deep learning networks, Zooming SlowMo and Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation, that are highly suited for accurately predicting images in between image pairs, therefore improving the temporal resolution of image series post-acquisition. We show that CAFI is capable of understanding the motion context of biological structures and can perform better than standard interpolation methods. We benchmark CAFI’s performance on 12 different datasets, obtained from four different microscopy modalities, and demonstrate its capabilities for single-particle tracking and nuclear segmentation. CAFI potentially allows for reduced light exposure and phototoxicity on the sample for improved long-term live-cell imaging. The models and the training and testing data are available via the ZeroCostDL4Mic platform."
223,Clinical application of tumour-in-normal contamination assessment from whole genome sequencing,"The unexpected contamination of normal samples with tumour cells reduces variant detection sensitivity, compromising downstream analyses in canonical tumour-normal analyses. Leveraging whole-genome sequencing data available at Genomics England, we develop a tool for normal sample contamination assessment, which we validate in silico and against minimal residual disease testing. From a systematic review of 
\(771\)
 patients with haematological malignancies and sarcomas, we find contamination across a range of cancer clinical indications and DNA sources, with highest prevalence in saliva samples from acute myeloid leukaemia patients, and sorted CD3+ T-cells from myeloproliferative neoplasms. Further exploration reveals 108 hotspot mutations in genes associated with haematological cancers at risk of being subtracted by standard variant calling pipelines. Our work highlights the importance of contamination assessment for accurate somatic variants detection in research and clinical settings, especially with large-scale sequencing projects being utilised to deliver accurate data from which to make clinical decisions for patient care."
224,Deep generative design of RNA family sequences,"RNA engineering has immense potential to drive innovation in biotechnology and medicine. Despite its importance, a versatile platform for the automated design of functional RNA is still lacking. Here, we propose RNA family sequence generator (RfamGen), a deep generative model that designs RNA family sequences in a data-efficient manner by explicitly incorporating alignment and consensus secondary structure information. RfamGen can generate novel and functional RNA family sequences by sampling points from a semantically rich and continuous representation. We have experimentally demonstrated the versatility of RfamGen using diverse RNA families. Furthermore, we confirmed the high success rate of RfamGen in designing functional ribozymes through a quantitative massively parallel assay. Notably, RfamGen successfully generates artificial sequences with higher activity than natural sequences. Overall, RfamGen significantly improves our ability to design functional RNA and opens up new potential for generative RNA engineering in synthetic biology."
225,Longitudinal single cell atlas identifies complex temporal relationship between type I interferon response and COVID-19 severity,"Due to the paucity of longitudinal molecular studies of COVID-19, particularly those covering the early stages of infection (Days 1-8 symptom onset), our understanding of host response over the disease course is limited. We perform longitudinal single cell RNA-seq on 286 blood samples from 108 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients, including 73 with early samples. We examine discrete cell subtypes and continuous cell states longitudinally, and we identify upregulation of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as the predominant early signature of subsequent worsening of symptoms, which we validate in an independent cohort and corroborate by plasma markers. However, ISG expression is dynamic in progressors, spiking early and then rapidly receding to the level of severity-matched non-progressors. In contrast, cross-sectional analysis shows that ISG expression is deficient and IFN suppressors such as 
SOCS3
 are upregulated in severe and critical COVID-19. We validate the latter in four independent cohorts, and 
SOCS3
 inhibition reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. In summary, we identify complexity in type I IFN response to COVID-19, as well as a potential avenue for host-directed therapy."
226,Determinants of epidemic size and the impacts of lulls in seasonal influenza virus circulation,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, levels of seasonal influenza virus circulation were unprecedentedly low, leading to concerns that a lack of exposure to influenza viruses, combined with waning antibody titres, could result in larger and/or more severe post-pandemic seasonal influenza epidemics. However, in most countries the first post-pandemic influenza season was not unusually large and/or severe. Here, based on an analysis of historical influenza virus epidemic patterns from 2002 to 2019, we show that historic lulls in influenza virus circulation had relatively minor impacts on subsequent epidemic size and that epidemic size was more substantially impacted by season-specific effects unrelated to the magnitude of circulation in prior seasons. From measurements of antibody levels from serum samples collected each year from 2017 to 2021, we show that the rate of waning of antibody titres against influenza virus during the pandemic was smaller than assumed in predictive models. Taken together, these results partially explain why the re-emergence of seasonal influenza virus epidemics was less dramatic than anticipated and suggest that influenza virus epidemic dynamics are not currently amenable to multi-season prediction."
227,"From interaction networks to interfaces, scanning intrinsically disordered regions using AlphaFold2","The revolution brought about by AlphaFold2 opens promising perspectives to unravel the complexity of protein-protein interaction networks. The analysis of interaction networks obtained from proteomics experiments does not systematically provide the delimitations of the interaction regions. This is of particular concern in the case of interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered regions, in which the interaction site is generally small. Using a dataset of protein-peptide complexes involving intrinsically disordered regions that are non-redundant with the structures used in AlphaFold2 training, we show that when using the full sequences of the proteins, AlphaFold2-Multimer only achieves 40% success rate in identifying the correct site and structure of the interface. By delineating the interaction region into fragments of decreasing size and combining different strategies for integrating evolutionary information, we manage to raise this success rate up to 90%. We obtain similar success rates using a much larger dataset of protein complexes taken from the ELM database. Beyond the correct identification of the interaction site, our study also explores specificity issues. We show the advantages and limitations of using the AlphaFold2 confidence score to discriminate between alternative binding partners, a task that can be particularly challenging in the case of small interaction motifs."
228,Leveraging single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify disease-critical fetal and adult brain cell types,"Prioritizing disease-critical cell types by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with functional data is a fundamental goal. Single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) have characterized cell types at high resolution, and studies integrating GWAS with scRNA-seq have shown promise, but studies integrating GWAS with scATAC-seq have been limited. Here, we identify disease-critical fetal and adult brain cell types by integrating GWAS summary statistics from 28 brain-related diseases/traits (average 
N
 = 298 K) with 3.2 million scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles from 83 cell types. We identified disease-critical fetal (respectively adult) brain cell types for 22 (respectively 23) of 28 traits using scATAC-seq, and for 8 (respectively 17) of 28 traits using scRNA-seq. Significant scATAC-seq enrichments included fetal photoreceptor cells for major depressive disorder, fetal ganglion cells for BMI, fetal astrocytes for ADHD, and adult VGLUT2 excitatory neurons for schizophrenia. Our findings improve our understanding of brain-related diseases/traits and inform future analyses."
229,Effective binning of metagenomic contigs using contrastive multi-view representation learning,"Contig binning plays a crucial role in metagenomic data analysis by grouping contigs from the same or closely related genomes. However, existing binning methods face challenges in practical applications due to the diversity of data types and the difficulties in efficiently integrating heterogeneous information. Here, we introduce COMEBin, a binning method based on contrastive multi-view representation learning. COMEBin utilizes data augmentation to generate multiple fragments (views) of each contig and obtains high-quality embeddings of heterogeneous features (sequence coverage and k-mer distribution) through contrastive learning. Experimental results on multiple simulated and real datasets demonstrate that COMEBin outperforms state-of-the-art binning methods, particularly in recovering near-complete genomes from real environmental samples. COMEBin outperforms other binning methods remarkably when integrated into metagenomic analysis pipelines, including the recovery of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB) and moderate or higher quality bins containing potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)."
230,Self Fourier shell correlation: properties and application to cryo-ET,"The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) is a measure of the similarity between two signals computed over corresponding shells in the frequency domain and has broad applications in microscopy. In structural biology, the FSC is ubiquitous in methods for validation, resolution determination, and signal enhancement. Computing the FSC usually requires two independent measurements of the same underlying signal, which can be limiting for some applications. Here, we analyze and extend on an approach to estimate the FSC from a single measurement. In particular, we derive the necessary conditions required to estimate the FSC from downsampled versions of a single noisy measurement. These conditions reveal additional corrections which we implement to increase the applicability of the method. We then illustrate two applications of our approach, first as an estimate of the global resolution from a single 3-D structure and second as a data-driven method for denoising tomographic reconstructions in electron cryo-tomography. These results provide general guidelines for computing the FSC from a single measurement and suggest new applications of the FSC in microscopy."
231,Transcription readthrough is prevalent in healthy human tissues and associated with inherent genomic features,"Transcription termination is a crucial step in the production of conforming mRNAs and functional proteins. Under cellular stress conditions, the transcription machinery fails to identify the termination site and continues transcribing beyond gene boundaries, a phenomenon designated as transcription readthrough. However, the prevalence and impact of this phenomenon in healthy human tissues remain unexplored. Here, we assessed transcription readthrough in almost 3000 transcriptome profiles representing 23 human tissues and found that 34% of the expressed protein-coding genes produced readthrough transcripts. The production of readthrough transcripts was restricted in genomic regions with high transcriptional activity and was associated with inefficient splicing and increased chromatin accessibility in terminal regions. In addition, we showed that these transcripts contained several binding sites for the same miRNA, unravelling a potential role as miRNA sponges. Overall, this work provides evidence that transcription readthrough is pervasive and non-stochastic, not only in abnormal conditions but also in healthy tissues. This suggests a potential role for such transcripts in modulating normal cellular functions."
232,Haplotype-aware modeling of cis-regulatory effects highlights the gaps remaining in eQTL data,"Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) are critical to understanding the mechanisms underlying disease-associated genomic loci. Nearly all protein-coding genes in the human genome have been associated with one or more eQTLs. Here we introduce a multi-variant generalization of allelic Fold Change (aFC), aFC-n, to enable quantification of the 
cis
-regulatory effects in multi-eQTL genes under the assumption that all eQTLs are known and conditionally independent. Applying aFC-n to 458,465 eQTLs in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data, we demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy over the original model in estimating the eQTL effect sizes and in predicting genetically regulated gene expression over the current tools. We characterize some of the empirical properties of the eQTL data and use this framework to assess the current state of eQTL data in terms of characterizing 
cis
-regulatory landscape in individual genomes. Notably, we show that 77.4% of the genes with an allelic imbalance in a sample show 0.5 log
2
 fold or more of residual imbalance after accounting for the eQTL data underlining the remaining gap in characterizing regulatory landscape in individual genomes. We further contrast this gap across tissue types, and ancestry backgrounds to identify its correlates and guide future studies."
233,Systematic detection of co-infection and intra-host recombination in more than 2 million global SARS-CoV-2 samples,"Systematic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections between different lineages and assessing the risk of intra-host recombinant emergence are crucial for forecasting viral evolution. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of more than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 raw read datasets submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Portal to identify co-infections and intra-host recombination. Co-infection was observed in 0.35% of the investigated cases. Two independent procedures were implemented to detect intra-host recombination. We show that sensitivity is predominantly determined by the density of lineage-defining mutations along the genome, thus we used an expanded list of mutually exclusive defining mutations of specific variant combinations to increase statistical power. We call attention to multiple challenges rendering recombinant detection difficult and provide guidelines for the reduction of false positives arising from chimeric sequences produced during PCR amplification. Additionally, we identify three recombination hotspots of Delta – Omicron BA.1 intra-host recombinants."
234,BIDCell: Biologically-informed self-supervised learning for segmentation of subcellular spatial transcriptomics data,"Recent advances in subcellular imaging transcriptomics platforms have enabled high-resolution spatial mapping of gene expression, while also introducing significant analytical challenges in accurately identifying cells and assigning transcripts. Existing methods grapple with cell segmentation, frequently leading to fragmented cells or oversized cells that capture contaminated expression. To this end, we present BIDCell, a self-supervised deep learning-based framework with biologically-informed loss functions that learn relationships between spatially resolved gene expression and cell morphology. BIDCell incorporates cell-type data, including single-cell transcriptomics data from public repositories, with cell morphology information. Using a comprehensive evaluation framework consisting of metrics in five complementary categories for cell segmentation performance, we demonstrate that BIDCell outperforms other state-of-the-art methods according to many metrics across a variety of tissue types and technology platforms. Our findings underscore the potential of BIDCell to significantly enhance single-cell spatial expression analyses, enabling great potential in biological discovery."
235,DiffDomain enables identification of structurally reorganized topologically associating domains,"Topologically associating domains (TADs) are critical structural units in three-dimensional genome organization of mammalian genome. Dynamic reorganizations of TADs between health and disease states are associated with essential genome functions. However, computational methods for identifying reorganized TADs are still in the early stages of development. Here, we present DiffDomain, an algorithm leveraging high-dimensional random matrix theory to identify structurally reorganized TADs using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi–C) contact maps. Method comparison using multiple real Hi–C datasets reveals that DiffDomain outperforms alternative methods for false positive rates, true positive rates, and identifying a new subtype of reorganized TADs. Applying DiffDomain to Hi–C data from different cell types and disease states demonstrates its biological relevance. Identified reorganized TADs are associated with structural variations and epigenomic changes such as changes in CTCF binding sites. By applying to a single-cell Hi–C data from mouse neuronal development, DiffDomain can identify reorganized TADs between cell types with reasonable reproducibility using pseudo-bulk Hi–C data from as few as 100 cells per condition. Moreover, DiffDomain reveals differential cell-to-population variability and heterogeneous cell-to-cell variability in TADs. Therefore, DiffDomain is a statistically sound method for better comparative analysis of TADs using both Hi–C and single-cell Hi–C data."
236,Revisiting the role of behavior-mediated structuring in the survival of populations in hostile environments,"Increasing the population density of target species is a major goal of ecosystem and agricultural management. This task is especially challenging in hazardous environments with a high abundance of natural enemies such as parasites and predators. Safe locations with lower mortality have been long considered a beneficial factor in enhancing population survival, being a promising tool in commercial fish farming and restoration of threatened species. Here we challenge this opinion and revisit the role of behavior structuring in a hostile environment in shaping the population density. We build a mathematical model, where individuals are structured according to their defensive tactics against natural enemies. The model predicts that although each safe zone enhances the survival of an individual, for an insufficient number of such zones, the entire population experiences a greater overall mortality. This is a result of the interplay of emergent dynamical behavioral structuring and strong intraspecific competition for safe zones. Non-plastic structuring in individuals’ boldness reduces the mentioned negative effects. We demonstrate emergence of non-plastic behavioral structuring: the evolutionary branching of a monomorphic population into a dimorphic one with bold/shy strains. We apply our modelling approach to explore fish farming of salmonids in an environment infected by trematode parasites."
237,Cryo-EM structure and B-factor refinement with ensemble representation,"Cryo-EM experiments produce images of macromolecular assemblies that are combined to produce three-dimensional density maps. Typically, atomic models of the constituent molecules are fitted into these maps, followed by a density-guided refinement. We introduce TEMPy-ReFF, a method for atomic structure refinement in cryo-EM density maps. Our method represents atomic positions as components of a Gaussian mixture model, utilising their variances as B-factors, which are used to derive an ensemble description. Extensively tested on a substantial dataset of 229 cryo-EM maps from EMDB ranging in resolution from 2.1-4.9 Å with corresponding PDB and CERES atomic models, our results demonstrate that TEMPy-ReFF ensembles provide a superior representation of cryo-EM maps. On a single-model basis, it performs similarly to the CERES re-refinement protocol, although there are cases where it provides a better fit to the map. Furthermore, our method enables the creation of composite maps free of boundary artefacts. TEMPy-ReFF is useful for better interpretation of flexible structures, such as those involving RNA, DNA or ligands."
238,Single-cell sequencing reveals increased LAMB3-positive basal keratinocytes and ZNF90-positive fibroblasts in autologous cultured epithelium,"Autologous cultured epithelium grafting (ACEG) presents a promising treatment for refractory vitiligo, yet concerns regarding infections and immunological reactions hinder its surgical use due to serum and feeder dependencies. Addressing this, we culture autologous epithelium under serum- and feeder-free (SFF) conditions, comparing its safety and efficacy with serum- and feeder-dependent (SFD) conditions in stable vitiligo patients, and we discover no significant differences in repigmentation between the SFF and SFD grafts. Single-cell RNA transcriptomics on SFF- and SFD-cultured epithelium alongside healthy skin reveal increased populations of LAMB3+ basal keratinocytes and ZNF90+ fibroblasts in the SFF sheets. Functional analyses showcase active cellular metabolism in LAMB3+ basal keratinocytes, vital in extracellular matrix homeostasis, while ZNF90+ fibroblasts demonstrate increased differentiation, essential in collagen formation for cell adhesion. Importantly, these cell populations in SFF sheets exhibit enhanced interactions with melanocytes compared to SFD sheets. Further, knockdown experiments of LAMB3 in keratinocytes and ZNF90 in fibroblasts lead to a downregulation in melanocyte ligand-receptor-related genes. Overall, SFF sheets demonstrate comparable efficacy to SFD sheets, offering superior safety. LAMB3+ basal keratinocytes and ZNF90+ fibroblasts act as potential drivers behind repigmentation in ACEG under SFF conditions. This study provides translational insights into ACEG repigmentation and potential therapeutic targets for vitiligo."
239,Ligand coupling mechanism of the human serotonin transporter differentiates substrates from inhibitors,"The presynaptic serotonin transporter (SERT) clears extracellular serotonin following vesicular release to ensure temporal and spatial regulation of serotonergic signalling and neurotransmitter homeostasis. Prescription drugs used to treat neurobehavioral disorders, including depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, trap SERT by blocking the transport cycle. In contrast, illicit drugs of abuse like amphetamines reverse SERT directionality, causing serotonin efflux. Both processes result in increased extracellular serotonin levels. By combining molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical experiments and using a homologous series of serotonin analogues, we uncovered the coupling mechanism between the substrate and the transporter, which triggers the uptake of serotonin. Free energy analysis showed that only scaffold-bound substrates could initiate SERT occlusion through attractive long-range electrostatic interactions acting on the bundle domain. The associated spatial requirements define substrate and inhibitor properties, enabling additional possibilities for rational drug design approaches."
240,Integrating genetic regulation and single-cell expression with GWAS prioritizes causal genes and cell types for glaucoma,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), characterized by retinal ganglion cell death, is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. However, its molecular and cellular causes are not well understood. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, but many patients have normal IOP. Colocalization and Mendelian randomization analysis of >240 POAG and IOP genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci and overlapping expression and splicing quantitative trait loci (e/sQTLs) in 49 GTEx tissues and retina prioritizes causal genes for 60% of loci. These genes are enriched in pathways implicated in extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, and vascular development. Analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq of glaucoma-relevant eye tissues reveals that the POAG and IOP colocalizing genes and genome-wide associations are enriched in specific cell types in the aqueous outflow pathways, retina, optic nerve head, peripapillary sclera, and choroid. This study nominates IOP-dependent and independent regulatory mechanisms, genes, and cell types that may contribute to POAG pathogenesis."
241,Contextualising the developability risk of antibodies with lambda light chains using enhanced therapeutic antibody profiling,"Antibodies with lambda light chains (
λ
-antibodies) are generally considered to be less developable than those with kappa light chains (
κ
-antibodies). Though this hypothesis has not been formally established, it has led to substantial systematic biases in drug discovery pipelines and thus contributed to kappa dominance amongst clinical-stage therapeutics. However, the identification of increasing numbers of epitopes preferentially engaged by 
λ
-antibodies shows there is a functional cost to neglecting to consider them as potential lead candidates. Here, we update our Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP) tool to use the latest data and machine learning-based structure prediction, and apply it to evaluate developability risk profiles for 
κ
-antibodies and 
λ
-antibodies based on their surface physicochemical properties. We find that while human 
λ
-antibodies on average have a higher risk of developability issues than 
κ
-antibodies, a sizeable proportion are assigned lower-risk profiles by TAP and should represent more tractable candidates for therapeutic development. Through a comparative analysis of the low- and high-risk populations, we highlight opportunities for strategic design that TAP suggests would enrich for more developable 
λ
-antibodies. Overall, we provide context to the differing developability of 
κ
- and 
λ
-antibodies, enabling a rational approach to incorporate more diversity into the initial pool of immunotherapeutic candidates."
242,Unsupervised and supervised discovery of tissue cellular neighborhoods from cell phenotypes,"It is poorly understood how different cells in a tissue organize themselves to support tissue functions. We describe the CytoCommunity algorithm for the identification of tissue cellular neighborhoods (TCNs) based on cell phenotypes and their spatial distributions. CytoCommunity learns a mapping directly from the cell phenotype space to the TCN space using a graph neural network model without intermediate clustering of cell embeddings. By leveraging graph pooling, CytoCommunity enables de novo identification of condition-specific and predictive TCNs under the supervision of sample labels. Using several types of spatial omics data, we demonstrate that CytoCommunity can identify TCNs of variable sizes with substantial improvement over existing methods. By analyzing risk-stratified colorectal and breast cancer data, CytoCommunity revealed new granulocyte-enriched and cancer-associated fibroblast-enriched TCNs specific to high-risk tumors and altered interactions between neoplastic and immune or stromal cells within and between TCNs. CytoCommunity can perform unsupervised and supervised analyses of spatial omics maps and enable the discovery of condition-specific cell–cell communication patterns across spatial scales."
243,"A fast, scalable and versatile tool for analysis of single-cell omics data","Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized the study of gene regulation in complex tissues. A major computational challenge in analyzing these datasets is to project the large-scale and high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while retaining the relative relationships between cells. This low dimension embedding is necessary to decompose cellular heterogeneity and reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, face challenges in computational efficiency and in comprehensively addressing cellular diversity across varied molecular modalities. Here we introduce a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, embodied in the Python package SnapATAC2, which not only achieves a more precise capture of single-cell omics data heterogeneities but also ensures efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling linearly with the number of cells. Our algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance, scalability and versatility across diverse single-cell omics datasets, including single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Hi-C and single-cell multi-omics datasets, underscoring its utility in advancing single-cell analysis."
244,Mechanism-centric regulatory network identifies NME2 and MYC programs as markers of Enzalutamide resistance in CRPC,"Heterogeneous response to Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, is a central problem in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) management. Genome-wide systems investigation of mechanisms that govern Enzalutamide resistance promise to elucidate markers of heterogeneous treatment response and salvage therapies for CRPC patients. Focusing on the de novo role of MYC as a marker of Enzalutamide resistance, here we reconstruct a CRPC-specific mechanism-centric regulatory network, connecting molecular pathways with their upstream transcriptional regulatory programs. Mining this network with signatures of Enzalutamide response identifies NME2 as an upstream regulatory partner of MYC in CRPC and demonstrates that NME2-MYC increased activities can predict patients at risk of resistance to Enzalutamide, independent of co-variates. Furthermore, our experimental investigations demonstrate that targeting MYC and its partner NME2 is beneficial in Enzalutamide-resistant conditions and could provide an effective strategy for patients at risk of Enzalutamide resistance and/or for patients who failed Enzalutamide treatment."
245,A new role for erythropoietin in the homeostasis of red blood cells,"The regulation of red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis is widely assumed to rely on the control of cell production by erythropoietin (EPO) and the destruction of cells at a fixed, species-specific age. In this work, we show that such a regulatory mechanism would be a poor homeostatic solution to satisfy the changing needs of the body. Effective homeostatic control would require RBC lifespan to be variable and tightly regulated. We suggest that EPO may control RBC lifespan by determining CD47 expression in newly formed RBCs and SIRP-
α
 expression in sinusoidal macrophages. EPO could also regulate the initiation and intensity of anti-RBC autoimmune responses that curtail RBC lifespan in some circumstances. These mechanisms would continuously modulate the rate of RBC destruction depending on oxygen availability. The control of RBC lifespan by EPO and autoimmunity emerges as a key mechanism in the homeostasis of RBCs."
246,Mesozoic evolution of cicadas and their origins of vocalization and root feeding,"Extant cicada (Hemiptera: Cicadoidea) includes widely distributed Cicadidae and relictual Tettigarctidae, with fossils ascribed to these two groups based on several distinct, minimally varying morphological differences that define their extant counterparts. However, directly assigning Mesozoic fossils to modern taxa may overlook the role of unique and transitional features provided by fossils in tracking their early evolutionary paths. Here, based on adult and nymphal fossils from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber of Myanmar, we explore the phylogenetic relationships and morphological disparities of fossil and extant cicadoids. Our results suggest that Cicadidae and Tettigarctidae might have diverged at or by the Middle Jurassic, with morphological evolution possibly shaped by host plant changes. The discovery of tymbal structures and anatomical analysis of adult fossils indicate that mid-Cretaceous cicadas were silent as modern Tettigarctidae or could have produced faint tymbal-related sounds. The discovery of final-instar nymphal and exuviae cicadoid fossils with fossorial forelegs and piercing-sucking mouthparts indicates that they had most likely adopted a subterranean lifestyle by the mid-Cretaceous, occupying the ecological niche of underground feeding on root. Our study traces the morphological, behavioral, and ecological evolution of Cicadoidea from the Mesozoic, emphasizing their adaptive traits and interactions with their living environments."
247,Developmental basis of SHH medulloblastoma heterogeneity,"Many genes that drive normal cellular development also contribute to oncogenesis. Medulloblastoma (MB) tumors likely arise from neuronal progenitors in the cerebellum, and we hypothesized that the heterogeneity observed in MBs with sonic hedgehog (SHH) activation could be due to differences in developmental pathways. To investigate this question, here we perform single-nucleus RNA sequencing on highly differentiated SHH MBs with extensively nodular histology and observed malignant cells resembling each stage of canonical granule neuron development. Through innovative computational approaches, we connect these results to published datasets and find that some established molecular subtypes of SHH MB appear arrested at different developmental stages. Additionally, using multiplexed proteomic imaging and MALDI imaging mass spectrometry, we identify distinct histological and metabolic profiles for highly differentiated tumors. Our approaches are applicable to understanding the interplay between heterogeneity and differentiation in other cancers and can provide important insights for the design of targeted therapies."
248,Gene-SGAN: discovering disease subtypes with imaging and genetic signatures via multi-view weakly-supervised deep clustering,"Disease heterogeneity has been a critical challenge for precision diagnosis and treatment, especially in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Many diseases can display multiple distinct brain phenotypes across individuals, potentially reflecting disease subtypes that can be captured using MRI and machine learning methods. However, biological interpretability and treatment relevance are limited if the derived subtypes are not associated with genetic drivers or susceptibility factors. Herein, we describe Gene-SGAN – a multi-view, weakly-supervised deep clustering method – which dissects disease heterogeneity by jointly considering phenotypic and genetic data, thereby conferring genetic correlations to the disease subtypes and associated endophenotypic signatures. We first validate the generalizability, interpretability, and robustness of Gene-SGAN in semi-synthetic experiments. We then demonstrate its application to real multi-site datasets from 28,858 individuals, deriving subtypes of Alzheimer’s disease and brain endophenotypes associated with hypertension, from MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism data. Derived brain phenotypes displayed significant differences in neuroanatomical patterns, genetic determinants, biological and clinical biomarkers, indicating potentially distinct underlying neuropathologic processes, genetic drivers, and susceptibility factors. Overall, Gene-SGAN is broadly applicable to disease subtyping and endophenotype discovery, and is herein tested on disease-related, genetically-associated neuroimaging phenotypes."
249,STEM enables mapping of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with transfer learning,"Profiling spatial variations of cellular composition and transcriptomic characteristics is important for understanding the physiology and pathology of tissues. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data depict spatial gene expression but the currently dominating high-throughput technology is yet not at single-cell resolution. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (SC) data provide high-throughput transcriptomic information at the single-cell level but lack spatial information. Integrating these two types of data would be ideal for revealing transcriptomic landscapes at single-cell resolution. We develop the method STEM (SpaTially aware EMbedding) for this purpose. It uses deep transfer learning to encode both ST and SC data into a unified spatially aware embedding space, and then uses the embeddings to infer SC-ST mapping and predict pseudo-spatial adjacency between cells in SC data. Semi-simulation and real data experiments verify that the embeddings preserved spatial information and eliminated technical biases between SC and ST data. We apply STEM to human squamous cell carcinoma and hepatic lobule datasets to uncover the localization of rare cell types and reveal cell-type-specific gene expression variation along a spatial axis. STEM is powerful for mapping SC and ST data to build single-cell level spatial transcriptomic landscapes, and can provide mechanistic insights into the spatial heterogeneity and microenvironments of tissues."
250,MarsGT: Multi-omics analysis for rare population inference using single-cell graph transformer,"Rare cell populations are key in neoplastic progression and therapeutic response, offering potential intervention targets. However, their computational identification and analysis often lag behind major cell types. To fill this gap, we introduce MarsGT: Multi-omics Analysis for Rare population inference using a Single-cell Graph Transformer. It identifies rare cell populations using a probability-based heterogeneous graph transformer on single-cell multi-omics data. MarsGT outperforms existing tools in identifying rare cells across 550 simulated and four real human datasets. In mouse retina data, it reveals unique subpopulations of rare bipolar cells and a Müller glia cell subpopulation. In human lymph node data, MarsGT detects an intermediate B cell population potentially acting as lymphoma precursors. In human melanoma data, it identifies a rare MAIT-like population impacted by a high IFN-I response and reveals the mechanism of immunotherapy. Hence, MarsGT offers biological insights and suggests potential strategies for early detection and therapeutic intervention of disease."
251,ARCTIC-3D: automatic retrieval and clustering of interfaces in complexes from 3D structural information,"The formation of a stable complex between proteins lies at the core of a wide variety of biological processes and has been the focus of countless experiments. The huge amount of information contained in the protein structural interactome in the Protein Data Bank can now be used to characterise and classify the existing biological interfaces. We here introduce ARCTIC-3D, a fast and user-friendly data mining and clustering software to retrieve data and rationalise the interface information associated with the protein input data. We demonstrate its use by various examples ranging from showing the increased interaction complexity of eukaryotic proteins, 20% of which on average have more than 3 different interfaces compared to only 10% for prokaryotes, to associating different functions to different interfaces. In the context of modelling biomolecular assemblies, we introduce the concept of “recognition entropy”, related to the number of possible interfaces of the components of a protein-protein complex, which we demonstrate to correlate with the modelling difficulty in classical docking approaches. The identified interface clusters can also be used to generate various combinations of interface-specific restraints for integrative modelling. The ARCTIC-3D software is freely available at github.com/haddocking/arctic3d and can be accessed as a web-service at wenmr.science.uu.nl/arctic3d."
252,MENDER: fast and scalable tissue structure identification in spatial omics data,"Tissue structure identification is a crucial task in spatial omics data analysis, for which increasingly complex models, such as Graph Neural Networks and Bayesian networks, are employed. However, whether increased model complexity can effectively lead to improved performance is a notable question in the field. Inspired by the consistent observation of cellular neighborhood structures across various spatial technologies, we propose Multi-range cEll coNtext DEciphereR (MENDER), for tissue structure identification. Applied on datasets of 3 brain regions and a whole-brain atlas, MENDER, with biology-driven design, offers substantial improvements over modern complex models while automatically aligning labels across slices, despite using much less running time than the second-fastest. MENDER’s identification power allows the uncovering of previously overlooked spatial domains that exhibit strong associations with brain aging. MENDER’s scalability makes it freely appliable on a million-level brain spatial atlas. MENDER’s discriminative power enables the differentiation of breast cancer patient subtypes obscured by single-cell analysis."
253,Enhancing geometric representations for molecules with equivariant vector-scalar interactive message passing,"Geometric deep learning has been revolutionizing the molecular modeling field. Despite the state-of-the-art neural network models are approaching ab initio accuracy for molecular property prediction, their applications, such as drug discovery and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, have been hindered by insufficient utilization of geometric information and high computational costs. Here we propose an equivariant geometry-enhanced graph neural network called ViSNet, which elegantly extracts geometric features and efficiently models molecular structures with low computational costs. Our proposed ViSNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple MD benchmarks, including MD17, revised MD17 and MD22, and achieves excellent chemical property prediction on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets. Furthermore, through a series of simulations and case studies, ViSNet can efficiently explore the conformational space and provide reasonable interpretability to map geometric representations to molecular structures."
254,LiLA: lipid lung-based ATLAS built through a comprehensive workflow designed for an accurate lipid annotation,"Accurate lipid annotation is crucial for understanding the role of lipids in health and disease and identifying therapeutic targets. However, annotating the wide variety of lipid species in biological samples remains challenging in untargeted lipidomic studies. In this work, we present a lipid annotation workflow based on LC-MS and MS/MS strategies, the combination of four bioinformatic tools, and a decision tree to support the accurate annotation and semi-quantification of the lipid species present in lung tissue from control mice. The proposed workflow allowed us to generate a lipid lung-based ATLAS (LiLA), which was then employed to unveil the lipidomic signatures of the 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 infection at two different time points for a deeper understanding of the disease progression. This workflow, combined with manual inspection strategies of MS/MS data, can enhance the annotation process for lipidomic studies and guide the generation of sample-specific lipidome maps. LiLA serves as a freely available data resource that can be employed in future studies to address lipidomic alterations in mice lung tissue."
255,Radiomic tractometry reveals tract-specific imaging biomarkers in white matter,"Tract-specific microstructural analysis of the brain’s white matter (WM) using diffusion MRI has been a driver for neuroscientific discovery with a wide range of applications. Tractometry enables localized tissue analysis along tracts but relies on bare summary statistics and reduces complex image information along a tract to few scalar values, and so may miss valuable information. This hampers the applicability of tractometry for predictive modelling. Radiomics is a promising method based on the analysis of numerous quantitative image features beyond what can be visually perceived, but has not yet been used for tract-specific analysis of white matter. Here we introduce radiomic tractometry (RadTract) and show that introducing rich radiomics-based feature sets into the world of tractometry enables improved predictive modelling while retaining the localization capability of tractometry. We demonstrate its value in a series of clinical populations, showcasing its performance in diagnosing disease subgroups in different datasets, as well as estimation of demographic and clinical parameters. We propose that RadTract could spark the establishment of a new generation of tract-specific imaging biomarkers with benefits for a range of applications from basic neuroscience to medical research."
256,Quick model-based viscoelastic clot strength predictions from blood protein concentrations for cybermedical coagulation control,"Cybermedical systems that regulate patient clotting in real time with personalized blood product delivery will improve treatment outcomes. These systems will harness popular viscoelastic assays of clot strength such as thromboelastography (TEG), which help evaluate coagulation status in numerous conditions: major surgery (e.g., heart, vascular, hip fracture, and trauma); liver cirrhosis and transplants; COVID-19; ICU stays; sepsis; obstetrics; diabetes; and coagulopathies like hemophilia. But these measurements are time-consuming, and thus impractical for urgent care and automated coagulation control. Because protein concentrations in a blood sample can be measured in about five minutes, we develop personalized, phenomenological, quick, control-oriented models that predict TEG curve outputs from input blood protein concentrations, to facilitate treatment decisions based on TEG curves. Here, we accurately predict, experimentally validate, and mechanistically justify curves and parameters for common TEG assays (Functional Fibrinogen, Citrated Native, Platelet Mapping, and Rapid TEG), and verify results with trauma patient clotting data."
257,Improving deep neural network generalization and robustness to background bias via layer-wise relevance propagation optimization,"Features in images’ backgrounds can spuriously correlate with the images’ classes, representing background bias. They can influence the classifier’s decisions, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans effect). The phenomenon generates deep neural networks (DNNs) that perform well on standard evaluation datasets but generalize poorly to real-world data. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) explains DNNs’ decisions. Here, we show that the optimization of LRP heatmaps can minimize the background bias influence on deep classifiers, hindering shortcut learning. By not increasing run-time computational cost, the approach is light and fast. Furthermore, it applies to virtually any classification architecture. After injecting synthetic bias in images’ backgrounds, we compared our approach (dubbed ISNet) to eight state-of-the-art DNNs, quantitatively demonstrating its superior robustness to background bias. Mixed datasets are common for COVID-19 and tuberculosis classification with chest X-rays, fostering background bias. By focusing on the lungs, the ISNet reduced shortcut learning. Thus, its generalization performance on external (out-of-distribution) test databases significantly surpassed all implemented benchmark models."
258,Image restoration of degraded time-lapse microscopy data mediated by near-infrared imaging,"Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is key to unraveling biological development and function; however, living systems, by their nature, permit only limited interrogation and contain untapped information that can only be captured by more invasive methods. Deep-tissue live imaging presents a particular challenge owing to the spectral range of live-cell imaging probes/fluorescent proteins, which offer only modest optical penetration into scattering tissues. Herein, we employ convolutional neural networks to augment live-imaging data with deep-tissue images taken on fixed samples. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks may be used to restore deep-tissue contrast in GFP-based time-lapse imaging using paired final-state datasets acquired using near-infrared dyes, an approach termed InfraRed-mediated Image Restoration (IR
2
). Notably, the networks are remarkably robust over a wide range of developmental times. We employ IR
2
 to enhance the information content of green fluorescent protein time-lapse images of zebrafish and 
Drosophila
 embryo/larval development and demonstrate its quantitative potential in increasing the fidelity of cell tracking/lineaging in developing pescoids. Thus, IR
2
 is poised to extend live imaging to depths otherwise inaccessible."
259,"The juxtamembrane linker of synaptotagmin 1 regulates Ca
2+
 binding via liquid-liquid phase separation","Synaptotagmin (syt) 1, a Ca
2+
 sensor for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, functions in vivo as a multimer. Syt1 senses Ca
2+
 via tandem C2-domains that are connected to a single transmembrane domain via a juxtamembrane linker. Here, we show that this linker segment harbors a lysine-rich, intrinsically disordered region that is necessary and sufficient to mediate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Interestingly, condensate formation negatively regulates the Ca
2+
-sensitivity of syt1. Moreover, Ca
2+
 and anionic phospholipids facilitate the observed phase separation, and increases in [Ca
2+
]
i
 promote the fusion of syt1 droplets in living cells. Together, these observations suggest a condensate-mediated feedback loop that serves to fine-tune the ability of syt1 to trigger release, via alterations in Ca
2+
 binding activity and potentially through the impact of LLPS on membrane curvature during fusion reactions. In summary, the juxtamembrane linker of syt1 emerges as a regulator of syt1 function by driving self-association via LLPS."
260,Petascale pipeline for precise alignment of images from serial section electron microscopy,"The reconstruction of neural circuits from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) images is being accelerated by automatic image segmentation methods. Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages."
261,Single-cell transcriptomics enable the characterization of local extension in retinoblastoma,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most prevalent ocular tumor of childhood, and its extraocular invasion significantly increases the risk of metastasis. Nevertheless, a single-cell characterization of RB local extension has been lacking. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on four RB samples (two from intraocular and two from extraocular RB patients), and integrate public datasets of five normal retina samples, four intraocular samples, and three extraocular RB samples to characterize RB local extension at the single-cell level. A total of 128,454 qualified cells are obtained in nine major cell types. Copy number variation inference reveals chromosome 6p amplification in cells derived from extraocular RB samples. In cellular heterogeneity analysis, we identified 10, 8, and 7 cell subpopulations in cone precursor like cells, retinoma like cells, and MKI67
+
 photoreceptorness decreased (MKI67
+
 PhrD) cells, respectively. A high expression level of 
SOX4
 was detected in cells from extraocular samples, especially in MKI67
+
 PhrD cells, which was verified in additional clinical RB samples. These results suggest that 
SOX4
 might drive RB local extension. Our study presents a single-cell transcriptomic landscape of intraocular and extraocular RB samples, improving our understanding of RB local extension at the single-cell resolution and providing potential therapeutic targets for RB patients."
262,Angiogenesis-on-a-chip coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing reveals spatially differential activations of autophagy along angiogenic sprouts,"Several functions of autophagy associated with proliferation, differentiation, and migration of endothelial cells have been reported. Due to lack of models recapitulating angiogenic sprouting, functional heterogeneity of autophagy in endothelial cells along angiogenic sprouts remains elusive. Here, we apply an angiogenesis-on-a-chip to reconstruct 3D sprouts with clear endpoints. We perform single-cell RNA sequencing of sprouting endothelial cells from our chip to reveal high activation of autophagy in two endothelial cell populations- proliferating endothelial cells in sprout basements and stalk-like endothelial cells near sprout endpoints- and further the reciprocal expression pattern of autophagy-related genes between stalk- and tip-like endothelial cells near sprout endpoints, implying an association of autophagy with tip-stalk cell specification. Our results suggest a model describing spatially differential roles of autophagy: quality control of proliferating endothelial cells in sprout basements for sprout elongation and tip-stalk cell specification near sprout endpoints, which may change strategies for developing autophagy-based anti-angiogenic therapeutics."
263,Improving deep learning protein monomer and complex structure prediction using DeepMSA2 with huge metagenomics data,"Leveraging iterative alignment search through genomic and metagenome sequence databases, we report the DeepMSA2 pipeline for uniform protein single- and multichain multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) construction. Large-scale benchmarks show that DeepMSA2 MSAs can remarkably increase the accuracy of protein tertiary and quaternary structure predictions compared with current state-of-the-art methods. An integrated pipeline with DeepMSA2 participated in the most recent CASP15 experiment and created complex structural models with considerably higher quality than the AlphaFold2-Multimer server (v.2.2.0). Detailed data analyses show that the major advantage of DeepMSA2 lies in its balanced alignment search and effective model selection, and in the power of integrating huge metagenomics databases. These results demonstrate a new avenue to improve deep learning protein structure prediction through advanced MSA construction and provide additional evidence that optimization of input information to deep learning-based structure prediction methods must be considered with as much care as the design of the predictor itself."
264,scMD facilitates cell type deconvolution using single-cell DNA methylation references,"The proliferation of single-cell RNA-sequencing data has led to the widespread use of cellular deconvolution, aiding the extraction of cell-type-specific information from extensive bulk data. However, those advances have been mostly limited to transcriptomic data. With recent developments in single-cell DNA methylation (scDNAm), there are emerging opportunities for deconvolving bulk DNAm data, particularly for solid tissues like brain that lack cell-type references. Due to technical limitations, current scDNAm sequences represent a small proportion of the whole genome for each single cell, and those detected regions differ across cells. This makes scDNAm data ultra-high dimensional and ultra-sparse. To deal with these challenges, we introduce scMD (single cell Methylation Deconvolution), a cellular deconvolution framework to reliably estimate cell type fractions from tissue-level DNAm data. To analyze large-scale complex scDNAm data, scMD employs a statistical approach to aggregate scDNAm data at the cell cluster level, identify cell-type marker DNAm sites, and create precise cell-type signature matrixes that surpass state-of-the-art sorted-cell or RNA-derived references. Through thorough benchmarking in several datasets, we demonstrate scMD’s superior performance in estimating cellular fractions from bulk DNAm data. With scMD-estimated cellular fractions, we identify cell type fractions and cell type-specific differentially methylated cytosines associated with Alzheimer’s disease."
265,"rworkflows
: automating reproducible practices for the R community","Despite calls to improve reproducibility in research, achieving this goal remains elusive even within computational fields. Currently, >50% of R packages are distributed exclusively through GitHub. While the trend towards sharing open-source software has been revolutionary, GitHub does not have any default built-in checks for minimal coding standards or software usability. This makes it difficult to assess the current quality R packages, or to consistently use them over time and across platforms. While GitHub-native solutions are technically possible, they require considerable time and expertise for each developer to write, implement, and maintain. To address this, we develop 
rworkflows
; a suite of tools to make robust continuous integration and deployment (
https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows
). 
rworkflows
 can be implemented by developers of all skill levels using a one-time R function call which has both sensible defaults and extensive options for customisation. Once implemented, any updates to the GitHub repository automatically trigger parallel workflows that install all software dependencies, run code checks, generate a dedicated documentation website, and deploy a publicly accessible containerised environment. By making the 
rworkflows
 suite free, automated, and simple to use, we aim to promote widespread adoption of reproducible practices across a continually growing R community."
266,ECOLE: Learning to call copy number variants on whole exome sequencing data,"Copy number variants (CNV) are shown to contribute to the etiology of several genetic disorders. Accurate detection of CNVs on whole exome sequencing (WES) data has been a long sought-after goal for use in clinics. This was not possible despite recent improvements in performance because algorithms mostly suffer from low precision and even lower recall on expert-curated gold standard call sets. Here, we present a deep learning-based somatic and germline CNV caller for WES data, named 
ECOLE
. Based on a variant of the transformer architecture, the model learns to call CNVs per exon, using high-confidence calls made on matched WGS samples. We further train and fine-tune the model with a small set of expert calls via transfer learning. We show that ECOLE achieves high performance on human expert labelled data for the first time with 68.7% precision and 49.6% recall. This corresponds to precision and recall improvements of 18.7% and 30.8% over the next best-performing methods, respectively. We also show that the same fine-tuning strategy using tumor samples enables ECOLE to detect RT-qPCR-validated variations in bladder cancer samples without the need for a control sample. ECOLE is available at 
https://github.com/ciceklab/ECOLE

267,Tuning parameters for polygenic risk score methods using GWAS summary statistics from training data,"Various polygenic risk scores (PRS) methods have been proposed to combine the estimated effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to predict genetic risks for common diseases, using data collected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Some methods require external individual-level GWAS dataset for parameter tuning, posing privacy and security-related concerns. Leaving out partial data for parameter tuning can also reduce model prediction accuracy. In this article, we propose PRStuning, a method that tunes parameters for different PRS methods using GWAS summary statistics from the training data. PRStuning predicts the PRS performance with different parameters, and then selects the best-performing parameters. Because directly using training data effects tends to overestimate the performance in the testing data, we adopt an empirical Bayes approach to shrinking the predicted performance in accordance with the genetic architecture of the disease. Extensive simulations and real data applications demonstrate PRStuning’s accuracy across PRS methods and parameters."
268,Deep learning-driven fragment ion series classification enables highly precise and sensitive de novo peptide sequencing,"Unlike for DNA and RNA, accurate and high-throughput sequencing methods for proteins are lacking, hindering the utility of proteomics in applications where the sequences are unknown including variant calling, neoepitope identification, and metaproteomics. We introduce Spectralis, a de novo peptide sequencing method for tandem mass spectrometry. Spectralis leverages several innovations including a convolutional neural network layer connecting peaks in spectra spaced by amino acid masses, proposing fragment ion series classification as a pivotal task for de novo peptide sequencing, and a peptide-spectrum confidence score. On spectra for which database search provided a ground truth, Spectralis surpassed 40% sensitivity at 90% precision, nearly doubling state-of-the-art sensitivity. Application to unidentified spectra confirmed its superiority and showcased its applicability to variant calling. Altogether, these algorithmic innovations and the substantial sensitivity increase in the high-precision range constitute an important step toward broadly applicable peptide sequencing."
269,MAPS: pathologist-level cell type annotation from tissue images through machine learning,"Highly multiplexed protein imaging is emerging as a potent technique for analyzing protein distribution within cells and tissues in their native context. However, existing cell annotation methods utilizing high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and necessitate iterative expert input, thereby constraining their scalability and practicality for extensive datasets. We introduce MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), a machine learning approach facilitating rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data. Validated on multiple in-house and publicly available MIBI and CODEX datasets, MAPS outperforms current annotation techniques in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving pathologist-level precision even for typically challenging cell types, including tumor cells of immune origin. By democratizing rapidly deployable and scalable machine learning annotation, MAPS holds significant potential to expedite advances in tissue biology and disease comprehension."
270,Integrative genotyping of cancer and immune phenotypes by long-read sequencing,"Single-cell transcriptomics has become the definitive method for classifying cell types and states, and can be augmented with genotype information to improve cell lineage identification. Due to constraints of short-read sequencing, current methods to detect natural genetic barcodes often require cumbersome primer panels and early commitment to targets. Here we devise a flexible long-read sequencing workflow and analysis pipeline, termed 
nanoranger
, that starts from intermediate single-cell cDNA libraries to detect cell lineage-defining features, including single-nucleotide variants, fusion genes, isoforms, sequences of chimeric antigen and TCRs. Through systematic analysis of these classes of natural ‘barcodes’, we define the optimal targets for nanoranger, namely those loci close to the 5’ end of highly expressed genes with transcript lengths shorter than 4 kB. As proof-of-concept, we apply nanoranger to longitudinal tracking of subclones of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and describe the heterogeneous isoform landscape of thousands of marrow-infiltrating immune cells. We propose that enhanced cellular genotyping using 
nanoranger
 can improve the tracking of single-cell tumor and immune cell co-evolution."
271,Integrated multi-omics analyses identify anti-viral host factors and pathways controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Host anti-viral factors are essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection but remain largely unknown due to the biases of previous large-scale studies toward pro-viral host factors. To fill in this knowledge gap, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR dropout screen and integrate analyses of the multi-omics data of the CRISPR screen, genome-wide association studies, single-cell RNA-Seq, and host-virus proteins or protein/RNA interactome. This study uncovers many host factors that are currently underappreciated, including the components of V-ATPases, ESCRT, and N-glycosylation pathways that modulate viral entry and/or replication. The cohesin complex is also identified as an anti-viral pathway, suggesting an important role of three-dimensional chromatin organization in mediating host-viral interaction. Furthermore, we discover another anti-viral regulator KLF5, a transcriptional factor involved in sphingolipid metabolism, which is up-regulated, and harbors genetic variations linked to COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. Anti-viral effects of three identified candidates (DAZAP2/VTA1/KLF5) are confirmed individually. Molecular characterization of DAZAP2/VTA1/KLF5-knockout cells highlights the involvement of genes related to the coagulation system in determining the severity of COVID-19. Together, our results provide further resources for understanding the host anti-viral network during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may help develop new countermeasure strategies."
