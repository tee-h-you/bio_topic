,Title,Abstract
0,Multigroup analysis of compositions of microbiomes with covariate adjustments and repeated measures,"Microbiome differential abundance analysis methods for two groups are well-established in the literature. However, many microbiome studies involve more than two groups, sometimes even ordered groups such as stages of a disease, and require different types of comparison. Standard pairwise comparisons are inefficient in terms of power and false discovery rates. In this Article, we propose a general framework, ANCOM-BC2, for performing a wide range of multigroup analyses with covariate adjustments and repeated measures. We illustrate our methodology through two real datasets. The first example explores the effects of aridity on the soil microbiome, and the second example investigates the effects of surgical interventions on the microbiome of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."
1,RENGE infers gene regulatory networks using time-series single-cell RNA-seq data with CRISPR perturbations,"Single-cell RNA-seq analysis coupled with CRISPR-based perturbation has enabled the inference of gene regulatory networks with causal relationships. However, a snapshot of single-cell CRISPR data may not lead to an accurate inference, since a gene knockout can influence multi-layered downstream over time. Here, we developed RENGE, a computational method that infers gene regulatory networks using a time-series single-cell CRISPR dataset. RENGE models the propagation process of the effects elicited by a gene knockout on its regulatory network. It can distinguish between direct and indirect regulations, which allows for the inference of regulations by genes that are not knocked out. RENGE therefore outperforms current methods in the accuracy of inferring gene regulatory networks. When used on a dataset we derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, RENGE yielded a network consistent with multiple databases and literature. Accurate inference of gene regulatory networks by RENGE would enable the identification of key factors for various biological systems."
2,ACIDES: on-line monitoring of forward genetic screens for protein engineering,"Forward genetic screens of mutated variants are a versatile strategy for protein engineering and investigation, which has been successfully applied to various studies like directed evolution (DE) and deep mutational scanning (DMS). While next-generation sequencing can track millions of variants during the screening rounds, the vast and noisy nature of the sequencing data impedes the estimation of the performance of individual variants. Here, we propose ACIDES that combines statistical inference and in-silico simulations to improve performance estimation in the library selection process by attributing accurate statistical scores to individual variants. We tested ACIDES first on a random-peptide-insertion experiment and then on multiple public datasets from DE and DMS studies. ACIDES allows experimentalists to reliably estimate variant performance on the fly and can aid protein engineering and research pipelines in a range of applications, including gene therapy."
3,Revealing hidden patterns in deep neural network feature space continuum via manifold learning,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) extract thousands to millions of task-specific features during model training for inference and decision-making. While visualizing these features is critical for comprehending the learning process and improving the performance of the DNNs, existing visualization techniques work only for classification tasks. For regressions, the feature points lie on a high dimensional continuum having an inherently complex shape, making a meaningful visualization of the features intractable. Given that the majority of deep learning applications are regression-oriented, developing a conceptual framework and computational method to reliably visualize the regression features is of great significance. Here, we introduce a manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) method for DNN feature visualization, which involves learning the manifold topology associated with the output and target labels of a DNN. MDA leverages the acquired topological information to preserve the local geometry of the feature space manifold and provides insightful visualizations of the DNN features, highlighting the appropriateness, generalizability, and adversarial robustness of a DNN. The performance and advantages of the MDA approach compared to the existing methods are demonstrated in different deep learning applications."
4,Transcriptional state dynamics lead to heterogeneity and adaptive tumor evolution in urothelial bladder carcinoma,"Intra-tumor heterogeneity contributes to treatment failure and poor survival in urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC). Analyzing transcriptome from a UBC cohort, we report that intra-tumor transcriptomic heterogeneity indicates co-existence of tumor cells in epithelial and mesenchymal-like transcriptional states and bi-directional transition between them occurs within and between tumor subclones. We model spontaneous and reversible transition between these partially heritable states in cell lines and characterize their population dynamics. SMAD3, KLF4 and PPARG emerge as key regulatory markers of the transcriptional dynamics. Nutrient limitation, as in the core of large tumors, and radiation treatment perturb the dynamics, initially selecting for a transiently resistant phenotype and then reconstituting heterogeneity and growth potential, driving adaptive evolution. Dominance of transcriptional states with low 
PPARG
 expression indicates an aggressive phenotype in UBC patients. We propose that phenotypic plasticity and dynamic, non-genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity modulate both the trajectory of disease progression and adaptive treatment response in UBC."
5,Spatiotemporal signaling underlies progressive vascular rarefaction in myocardial infarction,"Therapeutic angiogenesis represents a promising avenue to revascularize the ischemic heart. Its limited success is partly due to our poor understanding of the cardiac stroma, specifically mural cells, and their response to ischemic injury. Here, we combine single-cell and positional transcriptomics to assess the behavior of mural cells within the healing heart. In response to myocardial infarction, mural cells adopt an altered state closely associated with the infarct and retain a distinct lineage from fibroblasts. This response is concurrent with vascular rarefaction and reduced vascular coverage by mural cells. Positional transcriptomics reveals that the infarcted heart is governed by regional-dependent and temporally regulated programs. While the remote zone acts as an important source of pro-angiogenic signals, the infarct zone is accentuated by chronic activation of anti-angiogenic, pro-fibrotic, and inflammatory cues. Together, our work unveils the spatiotemporal programs underlying cardiac repair and establishes an association between vascular deterioration and mural cell dysfunction."
6,JOINTLY: interpretable joint clustering of single-cell transcriptomes,"Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (sxRNA-seq) is increasingly being used to characterise the transcriptomic state of cell types at homeostasis, during development and in disease. However, this is a challenging task, as biological effects can be masked by technical variation. Here, we present JOINTLY, an algorithm enabling joint clustering of sxRNA-seq datasets across batches. JOINTLY performs on par or better than state-of-the-art batch integration methods in clustering tasks and outperforms other intrinsically interpretable methods. We demonstrate that JOINTLY is robust against over-correction while retaining subtle cell state differences between biological conditions and highlight how the interpretation of JOINTLY can be used to annotate cell types and identify active signalling programs across cell types and pseudo-time. Finally, we use JOINTLY to construct a reference atlas of white adipose tissue (WATLAS), an expandable and comprehensive community resource, in which we describe four adipocyte subpopulations and map compositional changes in obesity and between depots."
7,Deciphering driver regulators of cell fate decisions from single-cell transcriptomics data with CEFCON,"Single-cell technologies enable the dynamic analyses of cell fate mapping. However, capturing the gene regulatory relationships and identifying the driver factors that control cell fate decisions are still challenging. We present CEFCON, a network-based framework that first uses a graph neural network with attention mechanism to infer a cell-lineage-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and then models cell fate dynamics through network control theory to identify driver regulators and the associated gene modules, revealing their critical biological processes related to cell states. Extensive benchmarking tests consistently demonstrated the superiority of CEFCON in GRN construction, driver regulator identification, and gene module identification over baseline methods. When applied to the mouse hematopoietic stem cell differentiation data, CEFCON successfully identified driver regulators for three developmental lineages, which offered useful insights into their differentiation from a network control perspective. Overall, CEFCON provides a valuable tool for studying the underlying mechanisms of cell fate decisions from single-cell RNA-seq data."
8,Merizo: a rapid and accurate protein domain segmentation method using invariant point attention,"The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, containing predictions for over 200 million proteins, has been met with enthusiasm over its potential in enriching structural biological research and beyond. Currently, access to the database is precluded by an urgent need for tools that allow the efficient traversal, discovery, and documentation of its contents. Identifying domain regions in the database is a non-trivial endeavour and doing so will aid our understanding of protein structure and function, while facilitating drug discovery and comparative genomics. Here, we describe a deep learning method for domain segmentation called Merizo, which learns to cluster residues into domains in a bottom-up manner. Merizo is trained on CATH domains and fine-tuned on AlphaFold2 models via self-distillation, enabling it to be applied to both experimental and AlphaFold2 models. As proof of concept, we apply Merizo to the human proteome, identifying 40,818 putative domains that can be matched to CATH representative domains."
9,A data analysis framework for combining multiple batches increases the power of isobaric proteomics experiments,"We present a framework for the analysis of multiplexed mass spectrometry proteomics data that reduces estimation error when combining multiple isobaric batches. Variations in the number and quality of observations have long complicated the analysis of isobaric proteomics data. Here we show that the power to detect statistical associations is substantially improved by utilizing models that directly account for known sources of variation in the number and quality of observations that occur across batches.
In a multibatch benchmarking experiment, our open-source software (msTrawler) increases the power to detect changes, especially in the range of less than twofold changes, while simultaneously increasing quantitative proteome coverage by utilizing more low-signal observations. Further analyses of previously published multiplexed datasets of 4 and 23 batches highlight both increased power and the ability to navigate complex missing data patterns without relying on unverifiable imputations or discarding reliable measurements."
10,Pathway centric analysis for single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data with GSDensity,"Advances in single-cell technology have enabled molecular dissection of heterogeneous biospecimens at unprecedented scales and resolutions. Cluster-centric approaches are widely applied in analyzing single-cell data, however they have limited power in dissecting and interpreting highly heterogenous, dynamically evolving data. Here, we present GSDensity, a graph-modeling approach that allows users to obtain pathway-centric interpretation and dissection of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data without performing clustering. Using pathway gene sets, we show that GSDensity can accurately detect biologically distinct cells and reveal novel cell-pathway associations ignored by existing methods. Moreover, GSDensity, combined with trajectory analysis can identify curated pathways that are active at various stages of mouse brain development. Finally, GSDensity can identify spatially relevant pathways in mouse brains and human tumors including those following high-order organizational patterns in the ST data. Particularly, we create a pan-cancer ST map revealing spatially relevant and recurrently active pathways across six different tumor types."
11,High-throughput deconvolution of 3D organoid dynamics at cellular resolution for cancer pharmacology with Cellos,"Three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures are flexible systems to interrogate cellular growth, morphology, multicellular spatial architecture, and cellular interactions in response to treatment. However, computational methods for analysis of 3D organoids with sufficiently high-throughput and cellular resolution are needed. Here we report Cellos, an accurate, high-throughput pipeline for 3D organoid segmentation using classical algorithms and nuclear segmentation using a trained Stardist-3D convolutional neural network. To evaluate Cellos, we analyze ~100,000 organoids with ~2.35 million cells from multiple treatment experiments. Cellos segments dye-stained or fluorescently-labeled nuclei and accurately distinguishes distinct labeled cell populations within organoids. Cellos can recapitulate traditional luminescence-based drug response of cells with complex drug sensitivities, while also quantifying changes in organoid and nuclear morphologies caused by treatment as well as cell-cell spatial relationships that reflect ecological affinity. Cellos provides powerful tools to perform high-throughput analysis for pharmacological testing and biological investigation of organoids based on 3D imaging."
12,LinRace: cell division history reconstruction of single cells using paired lineage barcode and gene expression data,"Lineage tracing technology using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has enabled simultaneous readouts of gene expressions and lineage barcodes in single cells, which allows for inference of cell lineage and cell types at the whole organism level. While most state-of-the-art methods for lineage reconstruction utilize only the lineage barcode data, methods that incorporate gene expressions are emerging. Effectively incorporating the gene expression data requires a reasonable model of how gene expression data changes along generations of divisions. Here, we present LinRace (Lineage Reconstruction with asymmetric cell division model), which integrates lineage barcode and gene expression data using asymmetric cell division model and infers cell lineages and ancestral cell states using Neighbor-Joining and maximum-likelihood heuristics. On both simulated and real data, LinRace outputs more accurate cell division trees than existing methods. With inferred ancestral states, LinRace can also show how a progenitor cell generates a large population of cells with various functionalities."
13,Local energetic frustration conservation in protein families and superfamilies,"Energetic local frustration offers a biophysical perspective to interpret the effects of sequence variability on protein families. Here we present a methodology to analyze local frustration patterns within protein families and superfamilies that allows us to uncover constraints related to stability and function, and identify differential frustration patterns in families with a common ancestry. We analyze these signals in very well studied protein families such as PDZ, SH3, ɑ and β globins and RAS families. Recent advances in protein structure prediction make it possible to analyze a vast majority of the protein space. An automatic and unsupervised proteome-wide analysis on the SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrates the potential of our approach to enhance our understanding of the natural phenotypic diversity of protein families beyond single protein instances. We apply our method to modify biophysical properties of natural proteins based on their family properties, as well as perform unsupervised analysis of large datasets to shed light on the physicochemical signatures of poorly characterized proteins such as the ones belonging to emergent pathogens."
14,Mapping protein states and interactions across the tree of life with co-fractionation mass spectrometry,"We present CFdb, a harmonized resource of interaction proteomics data from 411 co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) datasets spanning 21,703 fractions. Meta-analysis of this resource charts protein abundance, phosphorylation, and interactions throughout the tree of life, including a reference map of the human interactome. We show how large-scale CF-MS data can enhance analyses of individual CF-MS datasets, and exemplify this strategy by mapping the honey bee interactome."
15,Immune-response 3′UTR alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci contribute to variation in human complex traits and diseases,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of non-coding variants that are associated with human complex traits and diseases. The analysis of such GWAS variants in different contexts and physiological states is essential for deciphering the regulatory mechanisms underlying human disease. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a key post-transcriptional modification for most human genes that substantially impacts upon cell behavior. Here, we mapped 9,493 3′-untranslated region APA quantitative trait loci in 18 human immune baseline cell types and 8 stimulation conditions (immune 3′aQTLs). Through the comparison between baseline and stimulation data, we observed the high responsiveness of 3′aQTLs to immune stimulation (response 3′aQTLs). Co-localization and mendelian randomization analyses of immune 3′aQTLs identified 678 genes where 3′aQTL are associated with variation in complex traits, 27.3% of which were derived from response 3′aQTLs. Overall, these analyses reveal the role of immune 3′aQTLs in the determination of complex traits, providing new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying disease etiologies."
16,scPML: pathway-based multi-view learning for cell type annotation from single-cell RNA-seq data,"Recent developments in single-cell technology have enabled the exploration of cellular heterogeneity at an unprecedented level, providing invaluable insights into various fields, including medicine and disease research. Cell type annotation is an essential step in its omics research. The mainstream approach is to utilize well-annotated single-cell data to supervised learning for cell type annotation of new singlecell data. However, existing methods lack good generalization and robustness in cell annotation tasks, partially due to difficulties in dealing with technical differences between datasets, as well as not considering the heterogeneous associations of genes in regulatory mechanism levels. Here, we propose the scPML model, which utilizes various gene signaling pathway data to partition the genetic features of cells, thus characterizing different interaction maps between cells. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scPML performs better in cell type annotation and detection of unknown cell types from different species, platforms, and tissues."
17,A computational toolbox for the assembly yield of complex and heterogeneous structures,"The self-assembly of complex structures from a set of non-identical building blocks is a hallmark of soft matter and biological systems, including protein complexes, colloidal clusters, and DNA-based assemblies. Predicting the dependence of the equilibrium assembly yield on the concentrations and interaction energies of building blocks is highly challenging, owing to the difficulty of computing the entropic contributions to the free energy of the many structures that compete with the ground state configuration. While these calculations yield well known results for spherically symmetric building blocks, they do not hold when the building blocks have internal rotational degrees of freedom. Here we present an approach for solving this problem that works with arbitrary building blocks, including proteins with known structure and complex colloidal building blocks. Our algorithm combines classical statistical mechanics with recently developed computational tools for automatic differentiation. Automatic differentiation allows efficient evaluation of equilibrium averages over configurations that would otherwise be intractable. We demonstrate the validity of our framework by comparison to molecular dynamics simulations of simple examples, and apply it to calculate the yield curves for known protein complexes and for the assembly of colloidal shells."
18,Deep learning-based phenotyping reclassifies combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma,"Primary liver cancer arises either from hepatocytic or biliary lineage cells, giving rise to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA). Combined hepatocellular- cholangiocarcinomas (cHCC-CCA) exhibit equivocal or mixed features of both, causing diagnostic uncertainty and difficulty in determining proper management. Here, we perform a comprehensive deep learning-based phenotyping of multiple cohorts of patients. We show that deep learning can reproduce the diagnosis of HCC vs. CCA with a high performance. We analyze a series of 405 cHCC-CCA patients and demonstrate that the model can reclassify the tumors as HCC or ICCA, and that the predictions are consistent with clinical outcomes, genetic alterations and in situ spatial gene expression profiling. This type of approach could improve treatment decisions and ultimately clinical outcome for patients with rare and biphenotypic cancers such as cHCC-CCA."
19,Directing polymorph specific calcium carbonate formation with de novo protein templates,"Biomolecules modulate inorganic crystallization to generate hierarchically structured biominerals, but the atomic structure of the organic-inorganic interfaces that regulate mineralization remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that heterogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate could be achieved by a structured flat molecular template that pre-organizes calcium ions on its surface. To test this hypothesis, we design helical repeat proteins (DHRs) displaying regularly spaced carboxylate arrays on their surfaces and find that both protein monomers and protein-Ca
2+
 supramolecular assemblies directly nucleate nano-calcite with non-natural {110} or {202} faces while vaterite, which forms first in the absence of the proteins, is bypassed. These protein-stabilized nanocrystals then assemble by oriented attachment into calcite mesocrystals. We find further that nanocrystal size and polymorph can be tuned by varying the length and surface chemistry of the designed protein templates. Thus, bio-mineralization can be programmed using de novo protein design, providing a route to next-generation hybrid materials."
20,Prediction and stratification of longitudinal risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease across smoking behaviors,"Smoking is the leading risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worldwide, yet many people who never smoke develop COPD. We perform a longitudinal analysis of COPD in the UK Biobank to derive and validate the Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Score which captures additive and cumulative environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic exposure risks beyond tobacco smoking. The Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Score is more predictive of COPD than smoking status and pack-years. Individuals in the highest decile of the risk score have a greater risk for incident COPD compared to the remaining population. Never smokers in the highest decile of exposure risk are more likely to develop COPD than previous and current smokers in the lowest decile. In general, the prediction accuracy of the Social and Environmental Risk Score is lower in non-European populations. While smoking status is often considered in screening COPD, our finding highlights the importance of other non-smoking environmental and socioeconomic variables."
21,Accurate integration of single-cell DNA and RNA for analyzing intratumor heterogeneity using MaCroDNA,"Cancers develop and progress as mutations accumulate, and with the advent of single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing, researchers can observe these mutations and their transcriptomic effects and predict proteomic changes with remarkable temporal and spatial precision. However, to connect genomic mutations with their transcriptomic and proteomic consequences, cells with either only DNA data or only RNA data must be mapped to a common domain. For this purpose, we present MaCroDNA, a method that uses maximum weighted bipartite matching of per-gene read counts from single-cell DNA and RNA-seq data. Using ground truth information from colorectal cancer data, we demonstrate the advantage of MaCroDNA over existing methods in accuracy and speed. Exemplifying the utility of single-cell data integration in cancer research, we suggest, based on results derived using MaCroDNA, that genomic mutations of large effect size increasingly contribute to differential expression between cells as Barrett’s esophagus progresses to esophageal cancer, reaffirming the findings of the previous studies."
22,Accurate prediction of protein assembly structure by combining AlphaFold and symmetrical docking,"AlphaFold can predict the structures of monomeric and multimeric proteins with high accuracy but has a limit on the number of chains and residues it can fold. Here we show that a combination of AlphaFold and all-atom symmetric docking simulations enables highly accurate prediction of the structure of complex symmetrical assemblies. We present a method to predict the structure of complexes with cubic – tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral – symmetry from sequence. Focusing on proteins where AlphaFold can make confident predictions on the subunit structure, 27 cubic systems were assembled with a median TM-score of 0.99 and a DockQ score of 0.72. 21 had TM-scores of above 0.9 and were categorized as acceptable- to high-quality according to DockQ. The resulting models are energetically optimized and can be used for detailed studies of intermolecular interactions in higher-order symmetrical assemblies. The results demonstrate how explicit treatment of structural symmetry can significantly expand the size and complexity of AlphaFold predictions."
23,GNTD: reconstructing spatial transcriptomes with graph-guided neural tensor decomposition informed by spatial and functional relations,"Spatially-resolved RNA profiling has now been widely used to understand cells’ structural organizations and functional roles in tissues, yet it is challenging to reconstruct the whole spatial transcriptomes due to various inherent technical limitations in tissue section preparation and RNA capture and fixation in the application of the spatial RNA profiling technologies. Here, we introduce a graph-guided neural tensor decomposition (GNTD) model for reconstructing whole spatial transcriptomes in tissues. GNTD employs a hierarchical tensor structure and formulation to explicitly model the high-order spatial gene expression data with a hierarchical nonlinear decomposition in a three-layer neural network, enhanced by spatial relations among the capture spots and gene functional relations for accurate reconstruction from highly sparse spatial profiling data. Extensive experiments on 22 Visium spatial transcriptomics datasets and 3 high-resolution Stereo-seq datasets as well as simulation data demonstrate that GNTD consistently improves the imputation accuracy in cross-validations driven by nonlinear tensor decomposition and incorporation of spatial and functional information, and confirm that the imputed spatial transcriptomes provide a more complete gene expression landscape for downstream analyses of cell/spot clustering for tissue segmentation, and spatial gene expression clustering and visualizations."
24,Structural variants involved in high-altitude adaptation detected using single-molecule long-read sequencing,"Structural variants (SVs), accounting for a larger fraction of the genome than SNPs/InDels, are an important pool of genetic variation, enabling environmental adaptations. Here, we perform long-read sequencing data of 320 Tibetan and Han samples and show that SVs are highly involved in high-altitude adaptation. We expand the landscape of global SVs, apply robust models of selection and population differentiation combining SVs, SNPs and InDels, and use epigenomic analyses to predict enhancers, target genes and biological functions. We reveal diverse Tibetan-specific SVs affecting the regulatory circuitry of biological functions, including the hypoxia response, energy metabolism and pulmonary function. We find a Tibetan-specific deletion disrupts a super-enhancer and downregulates 
EPAS1
 using enhancer reporter, cellular knock-out and DNA pull-down assays. Our study expands the global SV landscape, reveals the role of gene-regulatory circuitry rewiring in human adaptation, and illustrates the diverse functional roles of SVs in human biology."
25,Genome-resolved metatranscriptomics reveals conserved root colonization determinants in a synthetic microbiota,"The identification of processes activated by specific microbes during microbiota colonization of plant roots has been hampered by technical constraints in metatranscriptomics. These include lack of reference genomes, high representation of host or microbial rRNA sequences in datasets, or difficulty to experimentally validate gene functions. Here, we recolonized germ-free 
Arabidopsis thaliana
 with a synthetic, yet representative root microbiota comprising 106 genome-sequenced bacterial and fungal isolates. We used multi-kingdom rRNA depletion, deep RNA-sequencing and read mapping against reference microbial genomes to analyse the in planta metatranscriptome of abundant colonizers. We identified over 3,000 microbial genes that were differentially regulated at the soil-root interface. Translation and energy production processes were consistently activated in planta, and their induction correlated with bacterial strains’ abundance in roots. Finally, we used targeted mutagenesis to show that several genes consistently induced by multiple bacteria are required for root colonization in one of the abundant bacterial strains (a genetically tractable 
Rhodanobacter
). Our results indicate that microbiota members activate strain-specific processes but also common gene sets to colonize plant roots."
26,Video-rate 3D imaging of living cells using Fourier view-channel-depth light field microscopy,"Interrogation of subcellular biological dynamics occurring in a living cell often requires noninvasive imaging of the fragile cell with high spatiotemporal resolution across all three dimensions. It thereby poses big challenges to modern fluorescence microscopy implementations because the limited photon budget in a live-cell imaging task makes the achievable performance of conventional microscopy approaches compromise between their spatial resolution, volumetric imaging speed, and phototoxicity. Here, we incorporate a two-stage view-channel-depth (VCD) deep-learning reconstruction strategy with a Fourier light-field microscope based on diffractive optical element to realize fast 3D super-resolution reconstructions of intracellular dynamics from single diffraction-limited 2D light-filed measurements. This VCD-enabled Fourier light-filed imaging approach (F-VCD), achieves video-rate (50 volumes per second) 3D imaging of intracellular dynamics at a high spatiotemporal resolution of ~180 nm × 180 nm × 400 nm and strong noise-resistant capability, with which light field images with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) down to -1.62 dB could be well reconstructed. With this approach, we successfully demonstrate the 4D imaging of intracellular organelle dynamics, e.g., mitochondria fission and fusion, with ~5000 times of observation."
27,DeepRTAlign: toward accurate retention time alignment for large cohort mass spectrometry data analysis,"Retention time (RT) alignment is a crucial step in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomic and metabolomic experiments, especially for large cohort studies. The most popular alignment tools are based on warping function method and direct matching method. However, existing tools can hardly handle monotonic and non-monotonic RT shifts simultaneously. Here, we develop a deep learning-based RT alignment tool, DeepRTAlign, for large cohort LC-MS data analysis. DeepRTAlign has been demonstrated to have improved performances by benchmarking it against current state-of-the-art approaches on multiple real-world and simulated proteomic and metabolomic datasets. The results also show that DeepRTAlign can improve identification sensitivity without compromising quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, using the MS features aligned by DeepRTAlign, we trained and validated a robust classifier to predict the early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. DeepRTAlign provides an advanced solution to RT alignment in large cohort LC-MS studies, which is currently a major bottleneck in proteomics and metabolomics research."
28,UniKP: a unified framework for the prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters,"Prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is essential for designing and optimizing enzymes for various biotechnological and industrial applications, but the limited performance of current prediction tools on diverse tasks hinders their practical applications. Here, we introduce UniKP, a unified framework based on pretrained language models for the prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters, including enzyme turnover number (
k
cat
), Michaelis constant (
K
m
), and catalytic efficiency (
k
cat
 / 
K
m
), from protein sequences and substrate structures. A two-layer framework derived from UniKP (EF-UniKP) has also been proposed to allow robust 
k
cat
 prediction in considering environmental factors, including pH and temperature. In addition, four representative re-weighting methods are systematically explored to successfully reduce the prediction error in high-value prediction tasks. We have demonstrated the application of UniKP and EF-UniKP in several enzyme discovery and directed evolution tasks, leading to the identification of new enzymes and enzyme mutants with higher activity. UniKP is a valuable tool for deciphering the mechanisms of enzyme kinetics and enables novel insights into enzyme engineering and their industrial applications."
29,An archetype and scaling of developmental tissue dynamics across species,"Morphometric studies have revealed the existence of simple geometric relationships among various animal shapes. However, we have little knowledge of the mathematical principles behind the morphogenetic dynamics that form the organ/body shapes of different species. Here, we address this issue by focusing on limb morphogenesis in 
Gallus gallus domesticus
 (chicken) and 
Xenopus laevis
 (African clawed frog). To compare the deformation dynamics between tissues with different sizes/shapes as well as their developmental rates, we introduce a species-specific rescaled spatial coordinate and a common clock necessary for cross-species synchronization of developmental times. We find that tissue dynamics are well conserved across species under this spacetime coordinate system, at least from the early stages of development through the phase when basic digit patterning is established. For this developmental period, we also reveal that the tissue dynamics of both species are mapped with each other through a time-variant linear transformation in real physical space, from which hypotheses on a species-independent archetype of tissue dynamics and morphogenetic scaling are proposed."
30,High-throughput target trial emulation for Alzheimer’s disease drug repurposing with real-world data,"Target trial emulation is the process of mimicking target randomized trials using real-world data, where effective confounding control for unbiased treatment effect estimation remains a main challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed for this challenge, a systematic evaluation is still lacking. Here we emulated trials for thousands of medications from two large-scale real-world data warehouses, covering over 10 years of clinical records for over 170 million patients, aiming to identify new indications of approved drugs for Alzheimer’s disease. We assessed different propensity score models under the inverse probability of treatment weighting framework and suggested a model selection strategy for improved baseline covariate balancing. We also found that the deep learning-based propensity score model did not necessarily outperform logistic regression-based methods in covariate balancing. Finally, we highlighted five top-ranked drugs (pantoprazole, gabapentin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, and omeprazole) originally intended for other indications with potential benefits for Alzheimer’s patients."
31,Deep learning of cell spatial organizations identifies clinically relevant insights in tissue images,"Recent advancements in tissue imaging techniques have facilitated the visualization and identification of various cell types within physiological and pathological contexts. Despite the emergence of cell-cell interaction studies, there is a lack of methods for evaluating individual spatial interactions. In this study, we introduce Ceograph, a cell spatial organization-based graph convolutional network designed to analyze cell spatial organization (for example,. the cell spatial distribution, morphology, proximity, and interactions) derived from pathology images. Ceograph identifies key cell spatial organization features by accurately predicting their influence on patient clinical outcomes. In patients with oral potentially malignant disorders, our model highlights reduced structural concordance and increased closeness in epithelial substrata as driving features for an elevated risk of malignant transformation. In lung cancer patients, Ceograph detects elongated tumor nuclei and diminished stroma-stroma closeness as biomarkers for insensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With its potential to predict various clinical outcomes, Ceograph offers a deeper understanding of biological processes and supports the development of personalized therapeutic strategies."
32,vcfdist: accurately benchmarking phased small variant calls in human genomes,"Accurately benchmarking small variant calling accuracy is critical for the continued improvement of human whole genome sequencing. In this work, we show that current variant calling evaluations are biased towards certain variant representations and may misrepresent the relative performance of different variant calling pipelines. We propose solutions, first exploring the affine gap parameter design space for complex variant representation and suggesting a standard. Next, we present our tool vcfdist and demonstrate the importance of enforcing local phasing for evaluation accuracy. We then introduce the notion of partial credit for mostly-correct calls and present an algorithm for clustering dependent variants. Lastly, we motivate using alignment distance metrics to supplement precision-recall curves for understanding variant calling performance. We evaluate the performance of 64 phased Truth Challenge V2 submissions and show that vcfdist improves measured insertion and deletion performance consistency across variant representations from 
R
2
 = 0.97243 for baseline vcfeval to 0.99996 for vcfdist."
33,DeepMainmast: integrated protocol of protein structure modeling for cryo-EM with deep learning and structure prediction,"Three-dimensional structure modeling from maps is an indispensable step for studying proteins and their complexes with cryogenic electron microscopy. Although the resolution of determined cryogenic electron microscopy maps has generally improved, there are still many cases where tracing protein main chains is difficult, even in maps determined at a near-atomic resolution. Here we developed a protein structure modeling method, DeepMainmast, which employs deep learning to capture the local map features of amino acids and atoms to assist main-chain tracing. Moreover, we integrated AlphaFold2 with the de novo density tracing protocol to combine their complementary strengths and achieved even higher accuracy than each method alone. Additionally, the protocol is able to accurately assign the chain identity to the structure models of homo-multimers, which is not a trivial task for existing methods."
34,STalign: Alignment of spatial transcriptomics data using diffeomorphic metric mapping,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable high throughput gene expression characterization within thin tissue sections. However, comparing spatial observations across sections, samples, and technologies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we develop STalign to align ST datasets in a manner that accounts for partially matched tissue sections and other local non-linear distortions using diffeomorphic metric mapping. We apply STalign to align ST datasets within and across technologies as well as to align ST datasets to a 3D common coordinate framework. We show that STalign achieves high gene expression and cell-type correspondence across matched spatial locations that is significantly improved over landmark-based affine alignments. Applying STalign to align ST datasets of the mouse brain to the 3D common coordinate framework from the Allen Brain Atlas, we highlight how STalign can be used to lift over brain region annotations and enable the interrogation of compositional heterogeneity across anatomical structures. STalign is available as an open-source Python toolkit at

35,Delineating the early dissemination mechanisms of acral melanoma by integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses,"Acral melanoma (AM) is a rare subtype of melanoma characterized by a high incidence of lymph node (LN) metastasis, a critical factor in tumor dissemination and therapeutic decision-making. Here, we employ single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses to investigate the dynamic evolution of early AM dissemination. Our findings reveal substantial inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in AM, alongside a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and complex intercellular communication networks, particularly in patients with LN metastasis. Notably, we identify a strong association between 
MYC
+
 Melanoma (
MYC
+
MEL) and 
FGFBP2
+
NKT cells with LN metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LN metastasis requires a metabolic shift towards fatty acid oxidation (FAO) induced by MITF in 
MYC
+
MEL cells. Etomoxir, a clinically approved FAO inhibitor, can effectively suppress MITF-mediated LN metastasis. This comprehensive dataset enhances our understanding of LN metastasis in AM, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic targeting for the management of early AM dissemination."
36,"Phospholipids are imported into mitochondria by VDAC, a dimeric beta barrel scramblase","Mitochondria are double-membrane-bounded organelles that depend critically on phospholipids supplied by the endoplasmic reticulum. These lipids must cross the outer membrane to support mitochondrial function, but how they do this is unclear. We identify the Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC), an abundant outer membrane protein, as a scramblase-type lipid transporter that catalyzes lipid entry. On reconstitution into membrane vesicles, dimers of human VDAC1 and VDAC2 catalyze rapid transbilayer translocation of phospholipids by a mechanism that is unrelated to their channel activity. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of VDAC1 reveal that lipid scrambling occurs at a specific dimer interface where polar residues induce large water defects and bilayer thinning. The rate of phospholipid import into yeast mitochondria is an order of magnitude lower in the absence of VDAC homologs, indicating that VDACs provide the main pathway for lipid entry. Thus, VDAC isoforms, members of a superfamily of beta barrel proteins, moonlight as a class of phospholipid scramblases - distinct from alpha-helical scramblase proteins - that act to import lipids into mitochondria."
37,TubULAR: tracking in toto deformations of dynamic tissues via constrained maps,"A common motif in biology is the arrangement of cells into tubes, which further transform into complex shapes. Traditionally, analysis of dynamic tissues has relied on inspecting static snapshots, live imaging of cross-sections or tracking isolated cells in three dimensions. However, capturing the interplay between in-plane and out-of-plane behaviors requires following the full surface as it deforms and integrating cell-scale motions into collective, tissue-scale deformations. Here, we present an analysis framework that builds in toto maps of tissue deformations by following tissue parcels in a static material frame of reference. Our approach then relates in-plane and out-of-plane behaviors and decomposes complex deformation maps into elementary contributions. The tube-like surface Lagrangian analysis resource (TubULAR) provides an open-source implementation accessible either as a standalone toolkit or as an extension of the ImSAnE package used in the developmental biology community. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing shape change in the embryonic 
Drosophila
 midgut and beating zebrafish heart. The method naturally generalizes to in vitro and synthetic systems and provides ready access to the mechanical mechanisms relating genetic patterning to organ shape change."
38,Embryo mechanics cartography: inference of 3D force atlases from fluorescence microscopy,"Tissue morphogenesis results from a tight interplay between gene expression, biochemical signaling and mechanics. Although sequencing methods allow the generation of cell-resolved spatiotemporal maps of gene expression, creating similar maps of cell mechanics in three-dimensional (3D) developing tissues has remained a real challenge. Exploiting the foam-like arrangement of cells, we propose a robust end-to-end computational method called ‘foambryo’ to infer spatiotemporal atlases of cellular forces from fluorescence microscopy images of cell membranes. Our method generates precise 3D meshes of cells’ geometry and successively predicts relative cell surface tensions and pressures. We validate it with 3D foam simulations, study its noise sensitivity and prove its biological relevance in mouse, ascidian and worm embryos. 3D force inference allows us to recover mechanical features identified previously, but also predicts new ones, unveiling potential new insights on the spatiotemporal regulation of cell mechanics in developing embryos. Our code is freely available and paves the way for unraveling the unknown mechanochemical feedbacks that control embryo and tissue morphogenesis."
39,The PENGUIN approach to reconstruct protein interactions at enhancer-promoter regions and its application to prostate cancer,"We introduce Promoter-Enhancer-Guided Interaction Networks (PENGUIN), a method for studying protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks within enhancer-promoter interactions. PENGUIN integrates H3K27ac-HiChIP data with tissue-specific PPIs to define enhancer-promoter PPI networks (EPINs). We validated PENGUIN using cancer (LNCaP) and benign (LHSAR) prostate cell lines. Our analysis detected EPIN clusters enriched with the architectural protein CTCF, a regulator of enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF presence was coupled with the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same EPIN clusters, suggesting functional implications in PrCa. Within the EPINs displaying enrichments in both CTCF and PrCa SNPs, we also show enrichment in oncogenes. We substantiated our identified SNPs through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi screens experiments. Here we show that PENGUIN provides insights into the intricate interplay between enhancer-promoter interactions and PPI networks, which are crucial for identifying key genes and potential intervention targets.

40,Design and structural validation of peptide–drug conjugate ligands of the kappa-opioid receptor,"Despite the increasing number of GPCR structures and recent advances in peptide design, the development of efficient technologies allowing rational design of high-affinity peptide ligands for single GPCRs remains an unmet challenge. Here, we develop a computational approach for designing conjugates of lariat-shaped macrocyclized peptides and a small molecule opioid ligand. We demonstrate its feasibility by discovering chemical scaffolds for the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) with desired pharmacological activities. The designed De Novo Cyclic Peptide (DNCP)-β-naloxamine (NalA) exhibit in vitro potent mixed KOR agonism/mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism, nanomolar binding affinity, selectivity, and efficacy bias at KOR. Proof-of-concept in vivo efficacy studies demonstrate that DNCP-β-NalA(1) induces a potent KOR-mediated antinociception in male mice. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure (2.6 Å) of the DNCP-β-NalA–KOR–Gi1 complex and molecular dynamics simulations are harnessed to validate the computational design model. This reveals a network of residues in ECL2/3 and TM6/7 controlling the intrinsic efficacy of KOR. In general, our computational de novo platform overcomes extensive lead optimization encountered in ultra-large library docking and virtual small molecule screening campaigns and offers innovation for GPCR ligand discovery. This may drive the development of next-generation therapeutics for medical applications such as pain conditions."
41,"Automated neuron tracking inside moving and deforming 
C. elegans
 using deep learning and targeted augmentation","Reading out neuronal activity from three-dimensional (3D) functional imaging requires segmenting and tracking individual neurons. This is challenging in behaving animals if the brain moves and deforms. The traditional approach is to train a convolutional neural network with ground-truth (GT) annotations of images representing different brain postures. For 3D images, this is very labor intensive. We introduce ‘targeted augmentation’, a method to automatically synthesize artificial annotations from a few manual annotations. Our method (‘Targettrack’) learns the internal deformations of the brain to synthesize annotations for new postures by deforming GT annotations. This reduces the need for manual annotation and proofreading. A graphical user interface allows the application of the method end-to-end. We demonstrate Targettrack on recordings where neurons are labeled as key points or 3D volumes. Analyzing freely moving animals exposed to odor pulses, we uncover rich patterns in interneuron dynamics, including switching neuronal entrainment on and off."
42,Modeling fragment counts improves single-cell ATAC-seq analysis,"Single-cell ATAC sequencing coverage in regulatory regions is typically binarized as an indicator of open chromatin. Here we show that binarization is an unnecessary step that neither improves goodness of fit, clustering, cell type identification nor batch integration. Fragment counts, but not read counts, should instead be modeled, which preserves quantitative regulatory information. These results have immediate implications for single-cell ATAC sequencing analysis."
43,Uniform quantification of single-nucleus ATAC-seq data with Paired-Insertion Counting (PIC) and a model-based insertion rate estimator,"Existing approaches to scoring single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) feature matrices from sequencing reads are inconsistent, affecting downstream analyses and displaying artifacts. We show that, even with sparse single-cell data, quantitative counts are informative for estimating the regulatory state of a cell, which calls for a consistent treatment. We propose Paired-Insertion Counting as a uniform method for snATAC-seq feature characterization and provide a probability model for inferring latent insertion dynamics from snATAC-seq count matrices."
44,Organ-specific characteristics govern the relationship between histone code dynamics and transcriptional reprogramming during nitrogen response in tomato,"Environmental stimuli trigger rapid transcriptional reprogramming of gene networks. These responses occur in the context of the local chromatin landscape, but the contribution of organ-specific dynamic chromatin modifications in responses to external signals remains largely unexplored. We treated tomato seedlings with a supply of nitrate and measured the genome-wide changes of four histone marks, the permissive marks H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 and repressive mark H3K27me3, in shoots and roots separately, as well as H3K9me2 in shoots. Dynamic and organ-specific histone acetylation and methylation were observed at functionally relevant gene loci. Integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets generated from the same organ revealed largely syngenetic relations between changes in transcript levels and histone modifications, with the exception of H3K27me3 in shoots, where an increased level of this repressive mark is observed at genes activated by nitrate. Application of a machine learning approach revealed organ-specific rules regarding the importance of individual histone marks, as H3K36me3 is the most successful mark in predicting gene regulation events in shoots, while H3K4me3 is the strongest individual predictor in roots. Our integrated study substantiates a view that during plant environmental responses, the relationships between histone code dynamics and gene regulation are highly dependent on organ-specific contexts."
45,SEVtras delineates small extracellular vesicles at droplet resolution from single-cell transcriptomes,"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are emerging as pivotal players in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. However, a pressing challenge has been the lack of high-throughput techniques capable of unraveling the intricate heterogeneity of sEVs and decoding the underlying cellular behaviors governing sEV secretion. Here we leverage droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and introduce an algorithm, SEVtras, to identify sEV-containing droplets and estimate the sEV secretion activity (ESAI) of individual cells. Through extensive validations on both simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate SEVtras’ efficacy in capturing sEV-containing droplets and characterizing the secretion activity of specific cell types. By applying SEVtras to four tumor scRNA-seq datasets, we further illustrate that the ESAI can serve as a potent indicator of tumor progression, particularly in the early stages. With the increasing importance and availability of scRNA-seq datasets, SEVtras holds promise in offering valuable extracellular insights into the cell heterogeneity."
46,Accurate de novo peptide sequencing using fully convolutional neural networks,"De novo peptide sequencing, which does not rely on a comprehensive target sequence database, provides us with a way to identify novel peptides from tandem mass spectra. However, current de novo sequencing algorithms suffer from low accuracy and coverage, which hinders their application in proteomics. In this paper, we present 
PepNet
, a fully convolutional neural network for high accuracy de novo peptide sequencing. PepNet takes an MS/MS spectrum (represented as a high-dimensional vector) as input, and outputs the optimal peptide sequence along with its confidence score. The PepNet model is trained using a total of 3 million high-energy collisional dissociation MS/MS spectra from multiple human peptide spectral libraries. Evaluation results show that PepNet significantly outperforms current best-performing de novo sequencing algorithms (e.g. PointNovo and DeepNovo) in both peptide-level accuracy and positional-level accuracy. PepNet can sequence a large fraction of spectra that were not identified by database search engines, and thus could be used as a complementary tool to database search engines for peptide identification in proteomics. In addition, PepNet runs around 3x and 7x faster than PointNovo and DeepNovo on GPUs, respectively, thus being more suitable for the analysis of large-scale proteomics data."
47,Accurate and efficient estimation of local heritability using summary statistics and the linkage disequilibrium matrix,"Existing SNP-heritability estimators that leverage summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are much less efficient (i.e., have larger standard errors) than the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimators which require access to individual-level data. We introduce a new method for local heritability estimation—
H
eritability 
E
stimation with high 
E
fficiency using 
L
D and association 
S
ummary Statistics (HEELS)—that significantly improves the statistical efficiency of summary-statistics-based heritability estimator and attains comparable statistical efficiency as REML (with a relative statistical efficiency >92%). Moreover, we propose representing the empirical LD matrix as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a banded matrix. We show that this way of modeling the LD can not only reduce the storage and memory cost, but also improve the computational efficiency of heritability estimation. We demonstrate the statistical efficiency of HEELS and the advantages of our proposed LD approximation strategies both in simulations and through empirical analyses of the UK Biobank data."
48,Programmable de novo designed coiled coil-mediated phase separation in mammalian cells,"Membraneless liquid compartments based on phase-separating biopolymers have been observed in diverse cell types and attributed to weak multivalent interactions predominantly based on intrinsically disordered domains. The design of liquid-liquid phase separated (LLPS) condensates based on de novo designed tunable modules that interact in a well-understood, controllable manner could improve our understanding of this phenomenon and enable the introduction of new features. Here we report the construction of CC-LLPS in mammalian cells, based on designed coiled-coil (CC) dimer-forming modules, where the stability of CC pairs, their number, linkers, and sequential arrangement govern the transition between diffuse, liquid and immobile condensates and are corroborated by coarse-grained molecular simulations. Through modular design, we achieve multiple coexisting condensates, chemical regulation of LLPS, condensate fusion, formation from either one or two polypeptide components or LLPS regulation by a third polypeptide chain. These findings provide further insights into the principles underlying LLPS formation and a design platform for controlling biological processes."
49,Multi-domain and complex protein structure prediction using inter-domain interactions from deep learning,"Accurately capturing domain-domain interactions is key to understanding protein function and designing structure-based drugs. Although AlphaFold2 has made a breakthrough on single domain, it should be noted that the structure modeling for multi-domain protein and complex remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a multi-domain and complex structure assembly protocol, named DeepAssembly, based on domain segmentation and single domain modeling algorithms. Firstly, DeepAssembly uses a population-based evolutionary algorithm to assemble multi-domain proteins by inter-domain interactions inferred from a developed deep learning network. Secondly, protein complexes are assembled by means of domains rather than chains using DeepAssembly. Experimental results show that on 219 multi-domain proteins, the average inter-domain distance precision by DeepAssembly is 22.7% higher than that of AlphaFold2. Moreover, DeepAssembly improves accuracy by 13.1% for 164 multi-domain structures with low confidence deposited in AlphaFold database. We apply DeepAssembly for the prediction of 247 heterodimers. We find that DeepAssembly successfully predicts the interface (DockQ ≥ 0.23) for 32.4% of the dimers, suggesting a lighter way to assemble complex structures by treating domains as assembly units and using inter-domain interactions learned from monomer structures."
50,Spatial transcriptomics deconvolution at single-cell resolution using Redeconve,"Computational deconvolution with single-cell RNA sequencing data as reference is pivotal to interpreting spatial transcriptomics data, but the current methods are limited to cell-type resolution. Here we present Redeconve, an algorithm to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics data at single-cell resolution, enabling interpretation of spatial transcriptomics data with thousands of nuanced cell states. We benchmark Redeconve with the state-of-the-art algorithms on diverse spatial transcriptomics platforms and datasets and demonstrate the superiority of Redeconve in terms of accuracy, resolution, robustness, and speed. Application to a human pancreatic cancer dataset reveals cancer-clone-specific T cell infiltration, and application to lymph node samples identifies differential cytotoxic T cells between IgA+ and IgG+ spots, providing novel insights into tumor immunology and the regulatory mechanisms underlying antibody class switch."
51,Haplotype-based inference of recent effective population size in modern and ancient DNA samples,"Individuals sharing recent ancestors are likely to co-inherit large identical-by-descent (IBD) genomic regions. The distribution of these IBD segments in a population may be used to reconstruct past demographic events such as effective population size variation, but accurate IBD detection is difficult in ancient DNA data and in underrepresented populations with limited reference data. In this work, we introduce an accurate method for inferring effective population size variation during the past ~2000 years in both modern and ancient DNA data, called HapNe. HapNe infers recent population size fluctuations using either IBD sharing (HapNe-IBD) or linkage disequilibrium (HapNe-LD), which does not require phasing and can be computed in low coverage data, including data sets with heterogeneous sampling times. HapNe shows improved accuracy in a range of simulated demographic scenarios compared to currently available methods for IBD-based and LD-based inference of recent effective population size, while requiring fewer computational resources. We apply HapNe to several modern populations from the 1,000 Genomes Project, the UK Biobank, the Allen Ancient DNA Resource, and recently published samples from Iron Age Britain, detecting multiple instances of recent effective population size variation across these groups."
52,Autoencoder neural networks enable low dimensional structure analyses of microbial growth dynamics,"The ability to effectively represent microbiome dynamics is a crucial challenge in their quantitative analysis and engineering. By using autoencoder neural networks, we show that microbial growth dynamics can be compressed into low-dimensional representations and reconstructed with high fidelity. These low-dimensional embeddings are just as effective, if not better, than raw data for tasks such as identifying bacterial strains, predicting traits like antibiotic resistance, and predicting community dynamics. Additionally, we demonstrate that essential dynamical information of these systems can be captured using far fewer variables than traditional mechanistic models. Our work suggests that machine learning can enable the creation of concise representations of high-dimensional microbiome dynamics to facilitate data analysis and gain new biological insights."
53,AlphaFold predictions are valuable hypotheses and accelerate but do not replace experimental structure determination,"Artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction methods such as AlphaFold have revolutionized structural biology. The accuracies of these predictions vary, however, and they do not take into account ligands, covalent modifications or other environmental factors. Here, we evaluate how well AlphaFold predictions can be expected to describe the structure of a protein by comparing predictions directly with experimental crystallographic maps. In many cases, AlphaFold predictions matched experimental maps remarkably closely. In other cases, even very high-confidence predictions differed from experimental maps on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation, and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. We suggest considering AlphaFold predictions as exceptionally useful hypotheses. We further suggest that it is important to consider the confidence in prediction when interpreting AlphaFold predictions and to carry out experimental structure determination to verify structural details, particularly those that involve interactions not included in the prediction."
54,Augmenting interpretable models with large language models during training,"Recent large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable prediction performance for a growing array of tasks. However, their proliferation into high-stakes domains and compute-limited settings has created a burgeoning need for interpretability and efficiency. We address this need by proposing Aug-imodels, a framework for leveraging the knowledge learned by LLMs to build extremely efficient and interpretable prediction models. Aug-imodels use LLMs during fitting but not during inference, allowing complete transparency and often a speed/memory improvement of greater than 1000x for inference compared to LLMs. We explore two instantiations of Aug-imodels in natural-language processing: Aug-Linear, which augments a linear model with decoupled embeddings from an LLM and Aug-Tree, which augments a decision tree with LLM feature expansions. Across a variety of text-classification datasets, both outperform their non-augmented, interpretable counterparts. Aug-Linear can even outperform much larger models, e.g. a 6-billion parameter GPT-J model, despite having 10,000x fewer parameters and being fully transparent. We further explore Aug-imodels in a natural-language fMRI study, where they generate interesting interpretations from scientific data."
55,"CurveCurator: a recalibrated F-statistic to assess, classify, and explore significance of dose–response curves","Dose-response curves are key metrics in pharmacology and biology to assess phenotypic or molecular actions of bioactive compounds in a quantitative fashion. Yet, it is often unclear whether or not a measured response significantly differs from a curve without regulation, particularly in high-throughput applications or unstable assays. Treating potency and effect size estimates from random and true curves with the same level of confidence can lead to incorrect hypotheses and issues in training machine learning models. Here, we present CurveCurator, an open-source software that provides reliable dose-response characteristics by computing 
p
-values and false discovery rates based on a recalibrated F-statistic and a target-decoy procedure that considers dataset-specific effect size distributions. The application of CurveCurator to three large-scale datasets enables a systematic drug mode of action analysis and demonstrates its scalable utility across several application areas, facilitated by a performant, interactive dashboard for fast data exploration."
56,Engineered immunogens to elicit antibodies against conserved coronavirus epitopes,"Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 primarily target the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, which continually mutates to escape acquired immunity. Other regions in the spike S2 subunit, such as the stem helix and the segment encompassing residues 815-823 adjacent to the fusion peptide, are highly conserved across sarbecoviruses and are recognized by broadly reactive antibodies, providing hope that vaccines targeting these epitopes could offer protection against both current and emergent viruses. Here we employ computational modeling to design scaffolded immunogens that display the spike 815-823 peptide and the stem helix epitopes without the distracting and immunodominant receptor binding domain. These engineered proteins bind with high affinity and specificity to the mature and germline versions of previously identified broadly protective human antibodies. Epitope scaffolds interact with both sera and isolated monoclonal antibodies with broadly reactivity from individuals with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. When used as immunogens, epitope scaffolds elicit sera with broad betacoronavirus reactivity and protect as “boosts” against live virus challenge in mice, illustrating their potential as components of a future pancoronavirus vaccine."
57,Improved sequence mapping using a complete reference genome and lift-over,"Complete, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies promise improved analyses and the discovery of new variants, but many essential genomic resources remain associated with older reference genomes. Thus, there is a need to translate genomic features and read alignments between references. Here we describe a method called levioSAM2 that performs fast and accurate lift-over between assemblies using a whole-genome map. In addition to enabling the use of several references, we demonstrate that aligning reads to a high-quality reference (for example, T2T-CHM13) and lifting to an older reference (for example, Genome reference Consortium (GRC)h38) improves the accuracy of the resulting variant calls on the old reference. By leveraging the quality improvements of T2T-CHM13, levioSAM2 reduces small and structural variant calling errors compared with GRC-based mapping using real short- and long-read datasets. Performance is especially improved for a set of complex medically relevant genes, where the GRC references are lower quality."
58,Explainable machine learning for profiling the immunological synapse and functional characterization of therapeutic antibodies,"Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat severe diseases. Most of them alter immune cells and act within the immunological synapse; an essential cell-to-cell interaction to direct the humoral immune response. Although many antibody designs are generated and evaluated, a high-throughput tool for systematic antibody characterization and prediction of function is lacking. Here, we introduce the first comprehensive open-source framework, scifAI (single-cell imaging flow cytometry AI), for preprocessing, feature engineering, and explainable, predictive machine learning on imaging flow cytometry (IFC) data. Additionally, we generate the largest publicly available IFC dataset of the human immunological synapse containing over 2.8 million images. Using scifAI, we analyze class frequency and morphological changes under different immune stimulation. T cell cytokine production across multiple donors and therapeutic antibodies is quantitatively predicted in vitro, linking morphological features with function and demonstrating the potential to significantly impact antibody design. scifAI is universally applicable to IFC data. Given its modular architecture, it is straightforward to incorporate into existing workflows and analysis pipelines, e.g., for rapid antibody screening and functional characterization."
59,Integrating spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data using deep generative models with SpatialScope,"The rapid emergence of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies is revolutionizing our understanding of tissue spatial architecture and biology. Although current ST methods, whether based on next-generation sequencing (seq-based approaches) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (image-based approaches), offer valuable insights, they face limitations either in cellular resolution or transcriptome-wide profiling. To address these limitations, we present SpatialScope, a unified approach integrating scRNA-seq reference data and ST data using deep generative models. With innovation in model and algorithm designs, SpatialScope not only enhances seq-based ST data to achieve single-cell resolution, but also accurately infers transcriptome-wide expression levels for image-based ST data. We demonstrate SpatialScope’s utility through simulation studies and real data analysis from both seq-based and image-based ST approaches. SpatialScope provides spatial characterization of tissue structures at transcriptome-wide single-cell resolution, facilitating downstream analysis, including detecting cellular communication through ligand-receptor interactions, localizing cellular subtypes, and identifying spatially differentially expressed genes."
60,ZeroBind: a protein-specific zero-shot predictor with subgraph matching for drug-target interactions,"Existing drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction methods generally fail to generalize well to novel (unseen) proteins and drugs. In this study, we propose a protein-specific meta-learning framework ZeroBind with subgraph matching for predicting protein-drug interactions from their structures. During the meta-training process, ZeroBind formulates training a protein-specific model, which is also considered a learning task, and each task uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the protein graph embedding and the molecular graph embedding. Inspired by the fact that molecules bind to a binding pocket in proteins instead of the whole protein, ZeroBind introduces a weakly supervised subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) module to recognize the maximally informative and compressive subgraphs in protein graphs as potential binding pockets. In addition, ZeroBind trains the models of individual proteins as multiple tasks, whose importance is automatically learned with a task adaptive self-attention module to make final predictions. The results show that ZeroBind achieves superior performance on DTI prediction over existing methods, especially for those unseen proteins and drugs, and performs well after fine-tuning for those proteins or drugs with a few known binding partners."
61,Correcting modification-mediated errors in nanopore sequencing by nucleotide demodification and reference-based correction,"The accuracy of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing has significantly improved thanks to new flowcells, sequencing kits, and basecalling algorithms. However, novel modification types untrained in the basecalling models can seriously reduce the quality. Here we reports a set of ONT-sequenced genomes with unexpected low quality due to novel modification types. Demodification by whole-genome amplification significantly improved the quality but lost the epigenome. We also developed a reference-based method, Modpolish, for correcting modification-mediated errors while retaining the epigenome when a sufficient number of closely-related genomes is publicly available (default: top 20 genomes with at least 95% identity). Modpolish not only significantly improved the quality of in-house sequenced genomes but also public datasets sequenced by R9.4 and R10.4 (simplex). Our results suggested that novel modifications are prone to ONT systematic errors. Nevertheless, these errors are correctable by nucleotide demodification or Modpolish without prior knowledge of modifications."
62,Resurrecting ancestral antibiotics: unveiling the origins of modern lipid II targeting glycopeptides,"Antibiotics are central to modern medicine, and yet they are mainly the products of intra and inter-kingdom evolutionary warfare. To understand how nature evolves antibiotics around a common mechanism of action, we investigated the origins of an extremely valuable class of compounds, lipid II targeting glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs, exemplified by teicoplanin and vancomycin), which are used as last resort for the treatment of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Using a molecule-centred approach and computational techniques, we first predicted the nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line of paleomycin, the ancestral parent of lipid II targeting GPAs. Subsequently, we employed synthetic biology techniques to produce the predicted peptide and validated its antibiotic activity. We revealed the structure of paleomycin, which enabled us to address how nature morphs a peptide antibiotic scaffold through evolution. In doing so, we obtained temporal snapshots of key selection domains in nonribosomal peptide synthesis during the biosynthetic journey from ancestral, teicoplanin-like GPAs to modern GPAs such as vancomycin. Our study demonstrates the synergy of computational techniques and synthetic biology approaches enabling us to journey back in time, trace the temporal evolution of antibiotics, and revive these ancestral molecules. It also reveals the optimisation strategies nature has applied to evolve modern GPAs, laying the foundation for future efforts to engineer this important class of antimicrobial agents."
63,TRS: a method for determining transcript termini from RNAtag-seq sequencing data,"In bacteria, determination of the 3’ termini of transcripts plays an essential role in regulation of gene expression, affecting the functionality and stability of the transcript. Several experimental approaches were developed to identify the 3’ termini of transcripts, however, these were applied only to a limited number of bacteria and growth conditions. Here we present a straightforward approach to identify 3’ termini from widely available RNA-seq data without the need for additional experiments. Our approach relies on the observation that the RNAtag-seq sequencing protocol results in overabundance of reads mapped to transcript 3’ termini. We present TRS (Termini by Read Starts), a computational pipeline exploiting this property to identify 3’ termini in RNAtag-seq data, and show that the identified 3’ termini are highly reliable. Since RNAtag-seq data are widely available for many bacteria and growth conditions, our approach paves the way for studying bacterial transcription termination in an unprecedented scope."
64,PhenoSV: interpretable phenotype-aware model for the prioritization of genes affected by structural variants,"Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of genetic variation associated with phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. While long-read sequencing can discover over 20,000 SVs per human genome, interpreting their functional consequences remains challenging. Existing methods for identifying disease-related SVs focus on deletion/duplication only and cannot prioritize individual genes affected by SVs, especially for noncoding SVs. Here, we introduce PhenoSV, a phenotype-aware machine-learning model that interprets all major types of SVs and genes affected. PhenoSV segments and annotates SVs with diverse genomic features and employs a transformer-based architecture to predict their impacts under a multiple-instance learning framework. With phenotype information, PhenoSV further utilizes gene-phenotype associations to prioritize phenotype-related SVs. Evaluation on extensive human SV datasets covering all SV types demonstrates PhenoSV’s superior performance over competing methods. Applications in diseases suggest that PhenoSV can determine disease-related genes from SVs. A web server and a command-line tool for PhenoSV are available at

65,Data-driven grading of acute graft-versus-host disease,"Despite advances in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains its leading complication, yet with heterogeneous outcomes. Here, we analyzed aGVHD phenotypes and clinical classifications in depth in large, multicenter cohorts involving 3019 patients and addressed prevailing gaps by developing data-driven models. We compared, tested and verified these along with all conventional classifications in independent cohorts and found that data-driven grading outperformed conventional grading in Akaike information criterion and concordance index metrics. Data-driven classifications refined aGVHD assessment with up to 12 severity grades, which were associated with distinct nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and confirmed the key role of intestinal aGVHD. We developed an online calculator for physicians to implement principal component-derived grading (PC1). These results provide substantial insight into the evaluation of aGVHD phenotypes and multiorgan involvement, which relegates the exclusive reporting of overall aGVHD severity grades in transplant registries and clinical trials. Data-driven aGVHD grading provides an expandable platform to refine classification and transplant risk assessment."
66,Proteomic characterization of epithelial ovarian cancer delineates molecular signatures and therapeutic targets in distinct histological subtypes,"Clear cell carcinoma (CCC), endometrioid carcinoma (EC), and serous carcinoma (SC) are the major histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), whose differences in carcinogenesis are still unclear. Here, we undertake comprehensive proteomic profiling of 80 CCC, 79 EC, 80 SC, and 30 control samples. Our analysis reveals the prognostic or diagnostic value of dysregulated proteins and phosphorylation sites in important pathways. Moreover, protein co-expression network not only provides comprehensive view of biological features of each histological subtype, but also indicates potential prognostic biomarkers and progression landmarks. Notably, EOC have strong inter-tumor heterogeneity, with significantly different clinical characteristics, proteomic patterns and signaling pathway disorders in CCC, EC, and SC. Finally, we infer MPP7 protein as potential therapeutic target for SC, whose biological functions are confirmed in SC cells. Our proteomic cohort provides valuable resources for understanding molecular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies of distinct histological subtypes."
67,Plasma proteomic profiles predict individual future health risk,"Developing a single-domain assay to identify individuals at high risk of future events is a priority for multi-disease and mortality prevention. By training a neural network, we developed a disease/mortality-specific proteomic risk score (ProRS) based on 1461 Olink plasma proteins measured in 52,006 UK Biobank participants. This integrative score markedly stratified the risk for 45 common conditions, including infectious, hematological, endocrine, psychiatric, neurological, sensory, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary diseases, cancers, and mortality. The discriminations witnessed high accuracies achieved by ProRS for 10 endpoints (e.g., cancer, dementia, and death), with C-indexes exceeding 0.80. Notably, ProRS produced much better or equivalent predictive performance than established clinical indicators for almost all endpoints. Incorporating clinical predictors with ProRS enhanced predictive power for most endpoints, but this combination only exhibited limited improvement when compared to ProRS alone. Some proteins, e.g., GDF15, exhibited important discriminative values for various diseases. We also showed that the good discriminative performance observed could be largely translated into practical clinical utility. Taken together, proteomic profiles may serve as a replacement for complex laboratory tests or clinical measures to refine the comprehensive risk assessments of multiple diseases and mortalities simultaneously. Our models were internally validated in the UK Biobank; thus, further independent external validations are necessary to confirm our findings before application in clinical settings."
68,Ongoing shuffling of protein fragments diversifies core viral functions linked to interactions with bacterial hosts,"Biological modularity enhances evolutionary adaptability. This principle is vividly exemplified by bacterial viruses (phages), which display extensive genomic modularity. Phage genomes are composed of independent functional modules that evolve separately and recombine in various configurations. While genomic modularity in phages has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to protein modularity—proteins consisting of distinct building blocks that can evolve and recombine, enhancing functional and genetic diversity. Here, we use a set of 133,574 representative phage proteins and highly sensitive homology detection to capture instances of domain mosaicism, defined as fragment sharing between two otherwise unrelated proteins, and to understand its relationship with functional diversity in phage genomes. We discover that unrelated proteins from diverse functional classes frequently share homologous domains. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced within receptor-binding proteins, endolysins, and DNA polymerases. We also identify multiple instances of recent diversification via domain shuffling in receptor-binding proteins, neck passage structures, endolysins and some members of the core replication machinery, often transcending distant taxonomic and ecological boundaries. Our findings suggest that ongoing diversification via domain shuffling is reflective of a co-evolutionary arms race, driven by the need to overcome various bacterial resistance mechanisms against phages."
69,scDREAMER for atlas-level integration of single-cell datasets using deep generative model paired with adversarial classifier,"Integration of heterogeneous single-cell sequencing datasets generated across multiple tissue locations, time, and conditions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular states and expression programs underlying complex biological systems. Here, we present scDREAMER (
https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/scDREAMER
), a data-integration framework that employs deep generative models and adversarial training for both unsupervised and supervised (scDREAMER-Sup) integration of multiple batches. Using six real benchmarking datasets, we demonstrate that scDREAMER can overcome critical challenges including skewed cell type distribution among batches, nested batch-effects, large number of batches and conservation of development trajectory across batches. Our experiments also show that scDREAMER and scDREAMER-Sup outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised integration methods respectively in batch-correction and conservation of biological variation. Using a 1 million cells dataset, we demonstrate that scDREAMER is scalable and can perform atlas-level cross-species (e.g., human and mouse) integration while being faster than other deep-learning-based methods."
70,LipIDens: simulation assisted interpretation of lipid densities in cryo-EM structures of membrane proteins,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the determination of membrane protein structures in native-like environments. Characterising how membrane proteins interact with the surrounding membrane lipid environment is assisted by resolution of lipid-like densities visible in cryo-EM maps. Nevertheless, establishing the molecular identity of putative lipid and/or detergent densities remains challenging. Here we present LipIDens, a pipeline for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-assisted interpretation of lipid and lipid-like densities in cryo-EM structures. The pipeline integrates the implementation and analysis of multi-scale MD simulations for identification, ranking and refinement of lipid binding poses which superpose onto cryo-EM map densities. Thus, LipIDens enables direct integration of experimental and computational structural approaches to facilitate the interpretation of lipid-like cryo-EM densities and to reveal the molecular identities of protein-lipid interactions within a bilayer environment. We demonstrate this by application of our open-source LipIDens code to ten diverse membrane protein structures which exhibit lipid-like densities."
71,"A fully integrated, standalone stretchable device platform with in-sensor adaptive machine learning for rehabilitation","Post-surgical treatments of the human throat often require continuous monitoring of diverse vital and muscle activities. However, wireless, continuous monitoring and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and treatment evaluation of various diseases."
72,Detection of isoforms and genomic alterations by high-throughput full-length single-cell RNA sequencing in ovarian cancer,"Understanding the complex background of cancer requires genotype-phenotype information in single-cell resolution. Here, we perform long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on clinical samples from three ovarian cancer patients presenting with omental metastasis and increase the PacBio sequencing depth to 12,000 reads per cell. Our approach captures 152,000 isoforms, of which over 52,000 were not previously reported. Isoform-level analysis accounting for non-coding isoforms reveals 20% overestimation of protein-coding gene expression on average. We also detect cell type-specific isoform and poly-adenylation site usage in tumor and mesothelial cells, and find that mesothelial cells transition into cancer-associated fibroblasts in the metastasis, partly through the TGF-β/miR-29/Collagen axis. Furthermore, we identify gene fusions, including an experimentally validated 
IGF2BP2::TESPA1
 fusion, which is misclassified as high 
TESPA1
 expression in matched short-read data, and call mutations confirmed by targeted NGS cancer gene panel results. With these findings, we envision long-read scRNA-seq to become increasingly relevant in oncology and personalized medicine."
73,Robust mapping of spatiotemporal trajectories and cell–cell interactions in healthy and diseased tissues,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies generate multiple data types from biological samples, namely gene expression, physical distance between data points, and/or tissue morphology. Here we developed three computational-statistical algorithms that integrate all three data types to advance understanding of cellular processes. First, we present a spatial graph-based method, pseudo-time-space (PSTS), to model and uncover relationships between transcriptional states of cells across tissues undergoing dynamic change (e.g. neurodevelopment, brain injury and/or microglia activation, and cancer progression). We further developed a spatially-constrained two-level permutation (SCTP) test to study cell-cell interaction, finding highly interactive tissue regions across thousands of ligand-receptor pairs with markedly reduced false discovery rates. Finally, we present a spatial graph-based imputation method with neural network (stSME), to correct for technical noise/dropout and increase ST data coverage. Together, the algorithms that we developed, implemented in the comprehensive and fast stLearn software, allow for robust interrogation of biological processes within healthy and diseased tissues."
74,Paired single-cell multi-omics data integration with Mowgli,"The profiling of multiple molecular layers from the same set of cells has recently become possible. There is thus a growing need for multi-view learning methods able to jointly analyze these data. We here present Multi-Omics Wasserstein inteGrative anaLysIs (Mowgli), a novel method for the integration of paired multi-omics data with any type and number of omics. Of note, Mowgli combines integrative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Optimal Transport, enhancing at the same time the clustering performance and interpretability of integrative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. We apply Mowgli to multiple paired single-cell multi-omics data profiled with 10X Multiome, CITE-seq, and TEA-seq. Our in-depth benchmark demonstrates that Mowgli’s performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art in cell clustering and superior to the state-of-the-art once considering biological interpretability. Mowgli is implemented as a Python package seamlessly integrated within the scverse ecosystem and it is available at

75,Global pathogenomic analysis identifies known and candidate genetic antimicrobial resistance determinants in twelve species,"Surveillance programs for managing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have yielded thousands of genomes suited for data-driven mechanism discovery. We present a workflow integrating pangenomics, gene annotation, and machine learning to identify AMR genes at scale. When applied to 12 species, 27,155 genomes, and 69 drugs, we 1) find AMR gene transfer mostly confined within related species, with 925 genes in multiple species but just eight in multiple phylogenetic classes, 2) demonstrate that discovery-oriented support vector machines outperform contemporary methods at recovering known AMR genes, recovering 263 genes compared to 145 by Pyseer, and 3) identify 142 AMR gene candidates. Validation of two candidates in 
E. coli
 BW25113 reveals cases of conditional resistance: 
ΔcycA
 confers ciprofloxacin resistance in minimal media with D-serine, and 
frdD
 V111D confers ampicillin resistance in the presence of 
ampC
 by modifying the overlapping promoter. We expect this approach to be adaptable to other species and phenotypes."
76,Genome wide analysis revealed conserved domains involved in the effector discrimination of bacterial type VI secretion system,"Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) deliver effectors into target cells. Besides structural and effector proteins, many other proteins, such as adaptors, co-effectors and accessory proteins, are involved in this process. MIX domains can assist in the delivery of T6SS effectors when encoded as a stand-alone gene or fused at the N-terminal of the effector. However, whether there are other conserved domains exhibiting similar encoding forms to MIX in T6SS remains obscure. Here, we scanned publicly available bacterial genomes and established a database which include 130,825 T6SS 
vgrG
 loci from 45,041 bacterial genomes. Based on this database, we revealed six domain families encoded within 
vgrG
 loci, which are either fused at the C-terminus of VgrG/N-terminus of T6SS toxin or encoded by an independent gene. Among them, DUF2345 was further validated and shown to be indispensable for the T6SS effector delivery and LysM was confirmed to assist the interaction between VgrG and the corresponding effector. Together, our results implied that these widely distributed domain families with similar genetic configurations may be required for the T6SS effector recruitment process."
77,"p53 and p21 dynamics encode single-cell DNA damage levels, fine-tuning proliferation and shaping population heterogeneity","Cells must accurately and quickly detect DNA damage through a set of checkpoint mechanisms that enable repair and control proliferation. Heterogeneous levels of cellular stress and noisy signaling processes can lead to phenotypic variability but little is known about their role in underlying proliferation heterogeneity. Here we study two previously published single cell datasets and find that cells encode heterogeneous levels of endogenous and exogenous DNA damage to shape proliferation heterogeneity at the population level. Using a comprehensive time series analysis of short- and long-term signaling dynamics of p53 and p21, we show that DNA damage levels are quantitatively translated into p53 and p21 signal parameters in a gradual manner. Analyzing instantaneous proliferation and signaling differences among equally-radiated cells, we identify time-localized changes in the period of p53 pulses that drive cells out of a low proliferative state. Our findings suggest a novel role of the p53-p21 network in quantitatively encoding DNA damage strength and fine-tuning proliferation trajectories."
78,Evaluating 17 methods incorporating biological function with GWAS summary statistics to accelerate discovery demonstrates a tradeoff between high sensitivity and high positive predictive value,"Where sufficiently large genome-wide association study (GWAS) samples are not currently available or feasible, methods that leverage increasing knowledge of the biological function of variants may illuminate discoveries without increasing sample size. We comprehensively evaluated 17 functional weighting methods for identifying novel associations. We assessed the performance of these methods using published results from multiple GWAS waves across each of five complex traits. Although no method achieved both high sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for any trait, a subset of methods utilizing pleiotropy and expression quantitative trait loci nominated variants with high PPV (>75%) for multiple traits. Application of functionally weighting methods to enhance GWAS power for locus discovery is unlikely to circumvent the need for larger sample sizes in truly underpowered GWAS, but these results suggest that applying functional weighting to GWAS can accurately nominate additional novel loci from available samples for follow-up studies."
79,Combined NMR and molecular dynamics conformational filter identifies unambiguously dynamic ensembles of Dengue protease NS2B/NS3pro,"The dengue protease NS2B/NS3pro has been reported to adopt either an ‘open’ or a ‘closed’ conformation. We have developed a conformational filter that combines NMR with MD simulations to identify conformational ensembles that dominate in solution. Experimental values derived from relaxation parameters for the backbone and methyl side chains were compared with the corresponding back-calculated relaxation parameters of different conformational ensembles obtained from free MD simulations. Our results demonstrate a high prevalence for the ‘closed’ conformational ensemble while the ‘open’ conformation is absent, indicating that the latter conformation is most probably due to crystal contacts. Conversely, conformational ensembles in which the positioning of the co-factor NS2B results in a ‘partially’ open conformation, previously described in both MD simulations and X-ray studies, were identified by our conformational filter. Altogether, we believe that our approach allows for unambiguous identification of true conformational ensembles, an essential step for reliable drug discovery."
80,Cardinal v.3: a versatile open-source software for mass spectrometry imaging analysis,"Cardinal v.3 is an open-source software for reproducible analysis of mass spectrometry imaging experiments. A major update from its previous versions, Cardinal v.3 supports most mass spectrometry imaging workflows. Its analytical capabilities include advanced data processing such as mass recalibration, advanced statistical analyses such as single-ion segmentation and rough annotation-based classification, and memory-efficient analyses of large-scale multitissue experiments."
81,Uncovering developmental time and tempo using deep learning,"During animal development, embryos undergo complex morphological changes over time. Differences in developmental tempo between species are emerging as principal drivers of evolutionary novelty, but accurate description of these processes is very challenging. To address this challenge, we present here an automated and unbiased deep learning approach to analyze the similarity between embryos of different timepoints. Calculation of similarities across stages resulted in complex phenotypic fingerprints, which carry characteristic information about developmental time and tempo. Using this approach, we were able to accurately stage embryos, quantitatively determine temperature-dependent developmental tempo, detect naturally occurring and induced changes in the developmental progression of individual embryos, and derive staging atlases for several species de novo in an unsupervised manner. Our approach allows us to quantify developmental time and tempo objectively and provides a standardized way to analyze early embryogenesis."
82,Accurate prediction of protein–nucleic acid complexes using RoseTTAFoldNA,"Protein–RNA and protein–DNA complexes play critical roles in biology. Despite considerable recent advances in protein structure prediction, the prediction of the structures of protein–nucleic acid complexes without homology to known complexes is a largely unsolved problem. Here we extend the RoseTTAFold machine learning protein-structure-prediction approach to additionally predict nucleic acid and protein–nucleic acid complexes. We develop a single trained network, RoseTTAFoldNA, that rapidly produces three-dimensional structure models with confidence estimates for protein–DNA and protein–RNA complexes. Here we show that confident predictions have considerably higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods. RoseTTAFoldNA should be broadly useful for modeling the structure of naturally occurring protein–nucleic acid complexes, and for designing sequence-specific RNA and DNA-binding proteins."
83,SPACEL: deep learning-based characterization of spatial transcriptome architectures,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies detect mRNA expression in single cells/spots while preserving their two-dimensional (2D) spatial coordinates, allowing researchers to study the spatial distribution of the transcriptome in tissues; however, joint analysis of multiple ST slices and aligning them to construct a three-dimensional (3D) stack of the tissue still remain a challenge. Here, we introduce spatial architecture characterization by deep learning (SPACEL) for ST data analysis. SPACEL comprises three modules: Spoint embeds a multiple-layer perceptron with a probabilistic model to deconvolute cell type composition for each spot in a single ST slice; Splane employs a graph convolutional network approach and an adversarial learning algorithm to identify spatial domains that are transcriptomically and spatially coherent across multiple ST slices; and Scube automatically transforms the spatial coordinate systems of consecutive slices and stacks them together to construct a 3D architecture of the tissue. Comparisons against 19 state-of-the-art methods using both simulated and real ST datasets from various tissues and ST technologies demonstrate that SPACEL outperforms the others for cell type deconvolution, for spatial domain identification, and for 3D alignment, thus showcasing SPACEL as a valuable integrated toolkit for ST data processing and analysis."
84,Distinct transcriptomic profiles in children prior to the appearance of type 1 diabetes-linked islet autoantibodies and following enterovirus infection,"Although the genetic basis and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes have been studied extensively, how host responses to environmental factors might contribute to autoantibody development remains largely unknown. Here, we use longitudinal blood transcriptome sequencing data to characterize host responses in children within 12 months prior to the appearance of type 1 diabetes-linked islet autoantibodies, as well as matched control children. We report that children who present with insulin-specific autoantibodies first have distinct transcriptional profiles from those who develop GADA autoantibodies first. In particular, gene dosage-driven expression of 
GSTM1
 is associated with GADA autoantibody positivity. Moreover, compared with controls, we observe increased monocyte and decreased B cell proportions 9-12 months prior to autoantibody positivity, especially in children who developed antibodies against insulin first. Lastly, we show that control children present transcriptional signatures consistent with robust immune responses to enterovirus infection, whereas children who later developed islet autoimmunity do not. These findings highlight distinct immune-related transcriptomic differences between case and control children prior to case progression to islet autoimmunity and uncover deficient antiviral response in children who later develop islet autoimmunity."
85,A knowledge-guided pre-training framework for improving molecular representation learning,"Learning effective molecular feature representation to facilitate molecular property prediction is of great significance for drug discovery. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) via self-supervised learning techniques to overcome the challenge of data scarcity in molecular property prediction. However, current self-supervised learning-based methods suffer from two main obstacles: the lack of a well-defined self-supervised learning strategy and the limited capacity of GNNs. Here, we propose Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KPGT), a self-supervised learning framework to alleviate the aforementioned issues and provide generalizable and robust molecular representations. The KPGT framework integrates a graph transformer specifically designed for molecular graphs and a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy, to fully capture both structural and semantic knowledge of molecules. Through extensive computational tests on 63 datasets, KPGT exhibits superior performance in predicting molecular properties across various domains. Moreover, the practical applicability of KPGT in drug discovery has been validated by identifying potential inhibitors of two antitumor targets: hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Overall, KPGT can provide a powerful and useful tool for advancing the artificial intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery process."
86,Multi-layered maps of neuropil with segmentation-guided contrastive learning,"Maps of the nervous system that identify individual cells along with their type, subcellular components and connectivity have the potential to elucidate fundamental organizational principles of neural circuits. Nanometer-resolution imaging of brain tissue provides the necessary raw data, but inferring cellular and subcellular annotation layers is challenging. We present segmentation-guided contrastive learning of representations (SegCLR), a self-supervised machine learning technique that produces representations of cells directly from 3D imagery and segmentations. When applied to volumes of human and mouse cortex, SegCLR enables accurate classification of cellular subcompartments and achieves performance equivalent to a supervised approach while requiring 400-fold fewer labeled examples. SegCLR also enables inference of cell types from fragments as small as 10 μm, which enhances the utility of volumes in which many neurites are truncated at boundaries. Finally, SegCLR enables exploration of layer 5 pyramidal cell subtypes and automated large-scale analysis of synaptic partners in mouse visual cortex."
87,Evaluation of the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub for informing pandemic response under uncertainty,"Our ability to forecast epidemics far into the future is constrained by the many complexities of disease systems. Realistic longer-term projections may, however, be possible under well-defined scenarios that specify the future state of critical epidemic drivers. Since December 2020, the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) has convened multiple modeling teams to make months ahead projections of SARS-CoV-2 burden, totaling nearly 1.8 million national and state-level projections. Here, we find SMH performance varied widely as a function of both scenario validity and model calibration. We show scenarios remained close to reality for 22 weeks on average before the arrival of unanticipated SARS-CoV-2 variants invalidated key assumptions. An ensemble of participating models that preserved variation between models (using the linear opinion pool method) was consistently more reliable than any single model in periods of valid scenario assumptions, while projection interval coverage was near target levels. SMH projections were used to guide pandemic response, illustrating the value of collaborative hubs for longer-term scenario projections."
88,Inferring mitochondrial and cytosolic metabolism by coupling isotope tracing and deconvolution,"The inability to inspect metabolic activities within distinct subcellular compartments has been a major barrier to our understanding of eukaryotic cell metabolism. Previous work addressed this challenge by analyzing metabolism in isolated organelles, which grossly bias metabolic activity. Here, we describe a method for inferring physiological metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations in mitochondria and cytosol based on isotope tracing experiments performed with intact cells. This is made possible by computational deconvolution of metabolite isotopic labeling patterns and concentrations into cytosolic and mitochondrial counterparts, coupled with metabolic and thermodynamic modelling. Our approach lowers the uncertainty regarding compartmentalized fluxes and concentrations by one and three orders of magnitude compared to existing modelling approaches, respectively. We derive a quantitative view of mitochondrial and cytosolic metabolic activities in central carbon metabolism across cultured cell lines without performing cell fractionation, finding major variability in compartmentalized malate-aspartate shuttle fluxes. We expect our approach for inferring metabolism at a subcellular resolution to be instrumental for a variety of studies of metabolic dysfunction in human disease and for bioengineering."
89,scReadSim: a single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq read simulator,"Benchmarking single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) computational tools demands simulators to generate realistic sequencing reads. However, none of the few read simulators aim to mimic real data. To fill this gap, we introduce scReadSim, a single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq read simulator that allows user-specified ground truths and generates synthetic sequencing reads (in a FASTQ or BAM file) by mimicking real data. At both read-sequence and read-count levels, scReadSim mimics real scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Moreover, scReadSim provides ground truths, including unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts for scRNA-seq and open chromatin regions for scATAC-seq. In particular, scReadSim allows users to design cell-type-specific ground-truth open chromatin regions for scATAC-seq data generation. In benchmark applications of scReadSim, we show that UMI-tools achieves the top accuracy in scRNA-seq UMI deduplication, and HMMRATAC and MACS3 achieve the top performance in scATAC-seq peak calling."
90,Genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction and optimization using RNA-DNA interaction fingerprints,"The powerful CRISPR genome editing system is hindered by its off-target effects, and existing computational tools achieved limited performance in genome-wide off-target prediction due to the lack of deep understanding of the CRISPR molecular mechanism. In this study, we propose to incorporate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the computational analysis of CRISPR system, and present CRISOT, an integrated tool suite containing four related modules, i.e., CRISOT-FP, CRISOT-Score, CRISOT-Spec, CRISORT-Opti for RNA-DNA molecular interaction fingerprint generation, genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction, sgRNA specificity evaluation and sgRNA optimization of Cas9 system respectively. Our comprehensive computational and experimental tests reveal that CRISOT outperforms existing tools with extensive in silico validations and proof-of-concept experimental validations. In addition, CRISOT shows potential in accurately predicting off-target effects of the base editors and prime editors, indicating that the derived RNA-DNA molecular interaction fingerprint captures the underlying mechanisms of RNA-DNA interaction among distinct CRISPR systems. Collectively, CRISOT provides an efficient and generalizable framework for genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction, evaluation and sgRNA optimization for improved targeting specificity in CRISPR genome editing."
91,Integrative genome-wide analyses identify novel loci associated with kidney stones and provide insights into its genetic architecture,"Kidney stone disease (KSD) is a complex disorder with high heritability and prevalence. We performed a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for KSD to date, including 720,199 individuals with 17,969 cases in European population. We identified 44 susceptibility loci, including 28 novel loci. Cell type-specific analysis pinpointed the proximal tubule as the most relevant cells where susceptibility variants might act through a tissue-specific fashion. By integrating kidney-specific omics data, we prioritized 223 genes which strengthened the importance of ion homeostasis, including calcium and magnesium in stone formation, and suggested potential target drugs for the treatment. The genitourinary and digestive diseases showed stronger genetic correlations with KSD. In this study, we generate an atlas of candidate genes, tissue and cell types involved in the formation of KSD. In addition, we provide potential drug targets for KSD treatment and insights into shared regulation with other diseases."
92,Direct-acting antiviral resistance of Hepatitis C virus is promoted by epistasis,"Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) provide efficacious therapeutic treatments for chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) can greatly affect treatment outcomes and impede virological cure. While multiple DRMs have been observed for all currently used DAAs, the evolutionary determinants of such mutations are not currently well understood. Here, by considering DAAs targeting the nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein of HCV, we present results suggesting that epistasis plays an important role in the evolution of DRMs. Employing a sequence-based fitness landscape model whose predictions correlate highly with experimental data, we identify specific DRMs that are associated with strong epistatic interactions, and these are found to be enriched in multiple NS3-specific DAAs. Evolutionary modelling further supports that the identified DRMs involve compensatory mutational interactions that facilitate relatively easy escape from drug-induced selection pressures. Our results indicate that accounting for epistasis is important for designing future HCV NS3-targeting DAAs."
93,Sequence-based prediction of the intrinsic solubility of peptides containing non-natural amino acids,"Non-natural amino acids are increasingly used as building blocks in the development of peptide-based drugs as they expand the available chemical space to tailor function, half-life and other key properties. However, while the chemical space of modified amino acids (mAAs) such as residues containing post-translational modifications (PTMs) is potentially vast, experimental methods for measuring the developability properties of mAA-containing peptides are expensive and time consuming. To facilitate developability programs through computational methods, we present CamSol-PTM, a method that enables the fast and reliable sequence-based prediction of the intrinsic solubility of mAA-containing peptides in aqueous solution at room temperature. From a computational screening of 50,000 mAA-containing variants of three peptides, we selected five different small-size mAAs for a total number of 37 peptide variants for experimental validation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions by comparing the calculated and experimental solubility values. Our results indicate that the computational screening of mAA-containing peptides can extend by over four orders of magnitude the ability to explore the solubility chemical space of peptides and confirm that our method can accurately assess the solubility of peptides containing mAAs. This method is available as a web server at

94,ProRefiner: an entropy-based refining strategy for inverse protein folding with global graph attention,"Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) is an important task of protein design, which aims to design sequences compatible with a given backbone structure. Despite the prosperous development of algorithms for this task, existing methods tend to rely on noisy predicted residues located in the local neighborhood when generating sequences. To address this limitation, we propose an entropy-based residue selection method to remove noise in the input residue context. Additionally, we introduce ProRefiner, a memory-efficient global graph attention model to fully utilize the denoised context. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sequence design benchmarks in different design settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of ProRefiner in redesigning Transposon-associated transposase B, where six out of the 20 variants we propose exhibit improved gene editing activity."
95,Pan-cancer landscape of epigenetic factor expression predicts tumor outcome,"Oncogenic pathways that drive cancer progression reflect both genetic changes and epigenetic regulation. Here we stratified primary tumors from each of 24 TCGA adult cancer types based on the gene expression patterns of epigenetic factors (epifactors). The tumors for five cancer types (ACC, KIRC, LGG, LIHC, and LUAD) separated into two robust clusters that were better than grade or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in predicting clinical outcomes. The majority of epifactors that drove the clustering were also individually prognostic. A pan-cancer machine learning model deploying epifactor expression data for these five cancer types successfully separated the patients into poor and better outcome groups. Single-cell analysis of adult and pediatric tumors revealed that expression patterns associated with poor or worse outcomes were present in individual cells within tumors. Our study provides an epigenetic map of cancer types and lays a foundation for discovering pan-cancer targetable epifactors."
96,Improving resolution and resolvability of single-particle cryoEM structures using Gaussian mixture models,"Cryogenic electron microscopy is widely used in structural biology, but its resolution is often limited by the dynamics of the macromolecule. Here we developed a refinement protocol based on Gaussian mixture models that integrates particle orientation and conformation estimation and improves the alignment for flexible domains of protein structures. We demonstrated this protocol on multiple datasets, resulting in improved resolution and resolvability, locally and globally, by visual and quantitative measures."
97,Transcriptional responses of cancer cells to heat shock-inducing stimuli involve amplification of robust HSF1 binding,"Responses of cells to stimuli are increasingly discovered to involve the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors outside of known target genes. We wanted to determine to what extent the genome-wide binding and function of a transcription factor are shaped by the cell type versus the stimulus. To do so, we induced the Heat Shock Response pathway in two different cancer cell lines with two different stimuli and related the binding of its master regulator HSF1 to nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. Here, we show that HSF1 binding patterns retain their identity between basal conditions and under different magnitudes of activation, so that common HSF1 binding is globally associated with distinct transcription outcomes. HSF1-induced increase in DNA accessibility was modest in scale, but occurred predominantly at remote genomic sites. Apart from regulating transcription at existing elements including promoters and enhancers, HSF1 binding amplified during responses to stimuli may engage inactive chromatin."
98,Simulation-guided engineering of split GFPs with efficient β-strand photodissociation,"Green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) are ubiquitous for protein tagging and live-cell imaging. Split-GFPs are widely used to study protein-protein interactions by fusing proteins of interest to split GFP fragments that create a fluorophore upon typically irreversible complementation. Thus, controlled dissociation of the fragments is desirable. Although we have found that split strands can be photodissociated, the quantum efficiency of light-induced photodissociation of split GFPs is low. Traditional protein engineering approaches to increase efficiency, including extensive mutagenesis and screening, have proved difficult to implement. To reduce the search space, key states in the dissociation process are modeled by combining classical and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with QM/MM calculations, enabling the rational design and engineering of split GFPs with up to 20-fold faster photodissociation rates using non-intuitive amino acid changes. This demonstrates the feasibility of modeling complex molecular processes using state-of-the-art computational methods, and the potential of integrating computational methods to increase the success rate in protein engineering projects."
99,Gut microbial structural variation associates with immune checkpoint inhibitor response,"The gut microbiota may have an effect on the therapeutic resistance and toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, the associations between the highly variable genomes of gut bacteria and the effectiveness of ICIs remain unclear, despite the fact that merely a few gene mutations between similar bacterial strains may cause significant phenotypic variations. Here, using datasets from the gut microbiome of 996 patients from seven clinical trials, we systematically identify microbial genomic structural variants (SVs) using SGV-Finder. The associations between SVs and response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and immune-related adverse events are systematically explored by metagenome-wide association analysis and replicated in different cohorts. Associated SVs are located in multiple species, including 
Akkermansia muciniphila
, 
Dorea formicigenerans
, and 
Bacteroides caccae
. We find genes that encode enzymes that participate in glucose metabolism be harbored in these associated regions. This work uncovers a nascent layer of gut microbiome heterogeneity that is correlated with hosts’ prognosis following ICI treatment and represents an advance in our knowledge of the intricate relationships between microbiota and tumor immunotherapy."
100,Deep learning of human polyadenylation sites at nucleotide resolution reveals molecular determinants of site usage and relevance in disease,"The genomic distribution of cleavage and polyadenylation (polyA) sites should be co-evolutionally optimized with the local gene structure. Otherwise, spurious polyadenylation can cause premature transcription termination and generate aberrant proteins. To obtain mechanistic insights into polyA site optimization across the human genome, we develop deep/machine learning models to identify genome-wide putative polyA sites at unprecedented nucleotide-level resolution and calculate their strength and usage in the genomic context. Our models quantitatively measure position-specific motif importance and their crosstalk in polyA site formation and cleavage heterogeneity. The intronic site expression is governed by the surrounding splicing landscape. The usage of alternative polyA sites in terminal exons is modulated by their relative locations and distance to downstream genes. Finally, we apply our models to reveal thousands of disease- and trait-associated genetic variants altering polyadenylation activity. Altogether, our models represent a valuable resource to dissect molecular mechanisms mediating genome-wide polyA site expression and characterize their functional roles in human diseases."
101,Dimension-agnostic and granularity-based spatially variable gene identification using BSP,"Identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs) is critical in linking molecular cell functions with tissue phenotypes. Spatially resolved transcriptomics captures cellular-level gene expression with corresponding spatial coordinates in two or three dimensions and can be used to infer SVGs effectively. However, current computational methods may not achieve reliable results and often cannot handle three-dimensional spatial transcriptomic data. Here we introduce BSP (big-small patch), a non-parametric model by comparing gene expression pattens at two spatial granularities to identify SVGs from two or three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data in a fast and robust manner. This method has been extensively tested in simulations, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and high efficiency. BSP is further validated by substantiated biological discoveries in cancer, neural science, rheumatoid arthritis, and kidney studies with various types of spatial transcriptomics technologies."
102,Functional annotation of enzyme-encoding genes using deep learning with transformer layers,"Functional annotation of open reading frames in microbial genomes remains substantially incomplete. Enzymes constitute the most prevalent functional gene class in microbial genomes and can be described by their specific catalytic functions using the Enzyme Commission (EC) number. Consequently, the ability to predict EC numbers could substantially reduce the number of un-annotated genes. Here we present a deep learning model, DeepECtransformer, which utilizes transformer layers as a neural network architecture to predict EC numbers. Using the extensively studied 
Escherichia coli
 K-12 MG1655 genome, DeepECtransformer predicted EC numbers for 464 un-annotated genes. We experimentally validated the enzymatic activities predicted for three proteins (YgfF, YciO, and YjdM). Further examination of the neural network’s reasoning process revealed that the trained neural network relies on functional motifs of enzymes to predict EC numbers. Thus, DeepECtransformer is a method that facilitates the functional annotation of uncharacterized genes."
103,Deep learning and single-cell phenotyping for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility detection in Escherichia coli,"The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest public health challenges, already causing up to 1.2 million deaths annually and rising. Current culture-based turnaround times for bacterial identification in clinical samples and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are typically 18–24 h. We present a novel proof-of-concept methodological advance in susceptibility testing based on the deep-learning of single-cell specific morphological phenotypes directly associated with antimicrobial susceptibility in 
Escherichia coli
. Our models can reliably (80% single-cell accuracy) classify untreated and treated susceptible cells for a lab-reference fully susceptible 
E. coli
 strain, across four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, rifampicin and co-amoxiclav). For ciprofloxacin, we demonstrate our models reveal significant (
p
 < 0.001) differences between bacterial cell populations affected and unaffected by antibiotic treatment, and show that given treatment with a fixed concentration of 10 mg/L over 30 min these phenotypic effects correlate with clinical susceptibility defined by established clinical breakpoints. Deploying our approach on cell populations from six 
E. coli
 strains obtained from human bloodstream infections with varying degrees of ciprofloxacin resistance and treated with a range of ciprofloxacin concentrations, we show single-cell phenotyping has the potential to provide equivalent information to growth-based AST assays, but in as little as 30 min."
104,Interactome profiling of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a biosafety level-4 pathogen requiring urgent research and development efforts. The glycoproteins of CCHFV, Gn and Gc, are considered to play multiple roles in the viral life cycle by interactions with host cells; however, these interactions remain largely unclear to date. Here, we analyzed the cellular interactomes of CCHFV glycoproteins and identified 45 host proteins as high-confidence Gn/Gc interactors. These host molecules are involved in multiple cellular biological processes potentially associated with the physiological actions of the viral glycoproteins. Then, we elucidated the role of a representative cellular protein, HAX1. HAX1 interacts with Gn by its C-terminus, while its N-terminal region leads to mitochondrial localization. By the strong interaction, HAX1 sequestrates Gn to mitochondria, thus depriving Gn of its normal Golgi localization that is required for functional glycoprotein-mediated progeny virion packaging. Consistently, the inhibitory activity of HAX1 against viral packaging and hence propagation was further elucidated in the contexts of pseudotyped and authentic CCHFV infections in cellular and animal models. Together, the findings provide a systematic CCHFV Gn/Gc-cell protein-protein interaction map, but also unravel a HAX1/mitochondrion-associated host antiviral mechanism, which may facilitate further studies on CCHFV biology and therapeutic approaches."
105,Bio-friendly long-term subcellular dynamic recording by self-supervised image enhancement microscopy,"Fluorescence microscopy has become an indispensable tool for revealing the dynamic regulation of cells and organelles. However, stochastic noise inherently restricts optical interrogation quality and exacerbates observation fidelity when balancing the joint demands of high frame rate, long-term recording and low phototoxicity. Here we propose DeepSeMi, a self-supervised-learning-based denoising framework capable of increasing signal-to-noise ratio by over 12 dB across various conditions. With the introduction of newly designed eccentric blind-spot convolution filters, DeepSeMi effectively denoises images with no loss of spatiotemporal resolution. In combination with confocal microscopy, DeepSeMi allows for recording organelle interactions in four colors at high frame rates across tens of thousands of frames, monitoring migrasomes and retractosomes over a half day, and imaging ultra-phototoxicity-sensitive 
Dictyostelium
 cells over thousands of frames. Through comprehensive validations across various samples and instruments, we prove DeepSeMi to be a versatile and biocompatible tool for breaking the shot-noise limit."
106,High-fidelity 3D live-cell nanoscopy through data-driven enhanced super-resolution radial fluctuation,"Live-cell super-resolution microscopy enables the imaging of biological structure dynamics below the diffraction limit. Here we present enhanced super-resolution radial fluctuations (eSRRF), substantially improving image fidelity and resolution compared to the original SRRF method. eSRRF incorporates automated parameter optimization based on the data itself, giving insight into the trade-off between resolution and fidelity. We demonstrate eSRRF across a range of imaging modalities and biological systems. Notably, we extend eSRRF to three dimensions by combining it with multifocus microscopy. This realizes live-cell volumetric super-resolution imaging with an acquisition speed of ~1 volume per second. eSRRF provides an accessible super-resolution approach, maximizing information extraction across varied experimental conditions while minimizing artifacts. Its optimal parameter prediction strategy is generalizable, moving toward unbiased and optimized analyses in super-resolution microscopy."
107,"Unistrand piRNA clusters are an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to suppress endogenous retroviruses across the 
Drosophila
 genus","The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway prevents endogenous genomic parasites, i.e. transposable elements, from damaging the genetic material of animal gonadal cells. Specific regions in the genome, called piRNA clusters, are thought to define each species’ piRNA repertoire and therefore its capacity to recognize and silence specific transposon families. The unistrand cluster 
flamenco
 (
flam
) is essential in the somatic compartment of the 
Drosophila
 ovary to restrict 
Gypsy
-family transposons from infecting the neighbouring germ cells. Disruption of 
flam
 results in transposon de-repression and sterility, yet it remains unknown whether this silencing mechanism is present more widely. Here, we systematically characterise 119 
Drosophila
 species and identify five additional 
flam
-like clusters separated by up to 45 million years of evolution. Small RNA-sequencing validated these as bona-fide unistrand piRNA clusters expressed in somatic cells of the ovary, where they selectively target transposons of the 
Gypsy
 family. Together, our study provides compelling evidence of a widely conserved transposon silencing mechanism that co-evolved with virus-like 
Gypsy
-family transposons."
108,CLOOME: contrastive learning unlocks bioimaging databases for queries with chemical structures,"The field of bioimage analysis is currently impacted by a profound transformation, driven by the advancements in imaging technologies and artificial intelligence. The emergence of multi-modal AI systems could allow extracting and utilizing knowledge from bioimaging databases based on information from other data modalities. We leverage the multi-modal contrastive learning paradigm, which enables the embedding of both bioimages and chemical structures into a unified space by means of bioimage and molecular structure encoders. This common embedding space unlocks the possibility of querying bioimaging databases with chemical structures that induce different phenotypic effects. Concretely, in this work we show that a retrieval system based on multi-modal contrastive learning is capable of identifying the correct bioimage corresponding to a given chemical structure from a database of ~2000 candidate images with a top-1 accuracy >70 times higher than a random baseline. Additionally, the bioimage encoder demonstrates remarkable transferability to various further prediction tasks within the domain of drug discovery, such as activity prediction, molecule classification, and mechanism of action identification. Thus, our approach not only addresses the current limitations of bioimaging databases but also paves the way towards foundation models for microscopy images."
109,Cardiomyocyte-specific disruption of the circadian BMAL1–REV-ERBα/β regulatory network impacts distinct miRNA species in the murine heart,"Circadian disruption increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, through poorly understood mechanisms. Given that small RNA species are critical modulators of cardiac physiology/pathology, we sought to determine the extent to which cardiomyocyte circadian clock (CCC) disruption impacts cardiac small RNA species. Accordingly, we collected hearts from cardiomyocyte-specific Bmal1 knockout (CBK; a model of CCC disruption) and littermate control (CON) mice at multiple times of the day, followed by small RNA-seq. The data reveal 47 differentially expressed miRNAs species in CBK hearts. Subsequent bioinformatic analyses predict that differentially expressed miRNA species in CBK hearts influence processes such as circadian rhythmicity, cellular signaling, and metabolism. Of the induced miRNAs in CBK hearts, 7 are predicted to be targeted by the transcriptional repressors REV-ERBα/β (integral circadian clock components that are directly regulated by BMAL1). Similar to CBK hearts, cardiomyocyte-specific Rev-erbα/β double knockout (CM-RevDKO) mouse hearts exhibit increased let-7c-1-3p, miR-23b-5p, miR-139-3p, miR-5123, and miR-7068-3p levels. Importantly, 19 putative targets of these 5 miRNAs are commonly repressed in CBK and CM-RevDKO heart (of which 16 are targeted by let-7c-1-3p). These observations suggest that disruption of the circadian BMAL1–REV-ERBα/β regulatory network in the heart induces distinct miRNAs, whose mRNA targets impact critical cellular functions."
110,Deep learning-based image analysis identifies a DAT-negative subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons in the lateral Substantia nigra,"Here we present a deep learning-based image analysis platform (DLAP), tailored to autonomously quantify cell numbers, and fluorescence signals within cellular compartments, derived from RNAscope or immunohistochemistry. We utilised DLAP to analyse subtypes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic midbrain neurons in mouse and human brain-sections. These neurons modulate complex behaviour, and are differentially affected in Parkinson’s and other diseases. DLAP allows the analysis of large cell numbers, and facilitates the identification of small cellular subpopulations. Using DLAP, we identified a small subpopulation of TH-positive neurons (~5%), mainly located in the very lateral Substantia nigra (SN), that was immunofluorescence-negative for the plasmalemmal dopamine transporter (DAT), with ~40% smaller cell bodies. These neurons were negative for aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1, with a lower co-expression rate for dopamine-D2-autoreceptors, but a ~7-fold higher likelihood of calbindin-d28k co-expression (~70%). These results have important implications, as DAT is crucial for dopamine signalling, and is commonly used as a marker for dopaminergic SN neurons."
111,Enhancing alphafold-multimer-based protein complex structure prediction with MULTICOM in CASP15,"To enhance the AlphaFold-Multimer-based protein complex structure prediction, we developed a quaternary structure prediction system (MULTICOM) to improve the input fed to AlphaFold-Multimer and evaluate and refine its outputs. MULTICOM samples diverse multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and templates for AlphaFold-Multimer to generate structural predictions by using both traditional sequence alignments and Foldseek-based structure alignments, ranks structural predictions through multiple complementary metrics, and refines the structural predictions via a Foldseek structure alignment-based refinement method. The MULTICOM system with different implementations was blindly tested in the assembly structure prediction in the 15
th
 Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15) in 2022 as both server and human predictors. MULTICOM_qa ranked 3
rd
 among 26 CASP15 server predictors and MULTICOM_human ranked 7
th
 among 87 CASP15 server and human predictors. The average TM-score of the first predictions submitted by MULTICOM_qa for CASP15 assembly targets is ~0.76, 5.3% higher than ~0.72 of the standard AlphaFold-Multimer. The average TM-score of the best of top 5 predictions submitted by MULTICOM_qa is ~0.80, about 8% higher than ~0.74 of the standard AlphaFold-Multimer. Moreover, the Foldseek Structure Alignment-based Multimer structure Generation (FSAMG) method outperforms the widely used sequence alignment-based multimer structure generation."
112,A statistical framework for differential pseudotime analysis with multiple single-cell RNA-seq samples,"Pseudotime analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has been widely used to study dynamic gene regulatory programs along continuous biological processes. While many methods have been developed to infer the pseudotemporal trajectories of cells within a biological sample, it remains a challenge to compare pseudotemporal patterns with multiple samples (or replicates) across different experimental conditions. Here, we introduce 
Lamian
, a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. 
Lamian
 can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions while adjusting for batch effects, and to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory. Unlike existing methods that ignore sample variability, 
Lamian
 draws statistical inference after accounting for cross-sample variability and hence substantially reduces sample-specific false discoveries that are not generalizable to new samples. Using both real scRNA-seq and simulation data, including an analysis of differential immune response programs between COVID-19 patients with different disease severity levels, we demonstrate the advantages of 
Lamian
 in decoding cellular gene expression programs in continuous biological processes."
113,Mining cancer genomes for change-of-metabolic-function mutations,"Enzymes with novel functions are needed to enable new organic synthesis techniques. Drawing inspiration from gain-of-function cancer mutations that functionally alter proteins and affect cellular metabolism, we developed METIS (

S
creen). METIS identifies metabolism-altering cancer mutations using mutation recurrence rates and protein structure. We used METIS to screen 298,517 cancer mutations and identify 48 candidate mutations, including those previously identified to alter enzymatic function. Unbiased metabolomic profiling of cells exogenously expressing a candidate mutant (OGDHLp.A400T) supports an altered phenotype that boosts in vitro production of xanthosine, a pharmacologically useful chemical that is currently produced using unsustainable, water-intensive methods. We then applied METIS to 49 million cancer mutations, yielding a refined set of candidates that may impart novel enzymatic functions or contribute to tumor progression. Thus, METIS can be used to identify and catalog potentially-useful cancer mutations for green chemistry and therapeutic applications."
114,Leveraging information between multiple population groups and traits improves fine-mapping resolution,"Statistical fine-mapping helps to pinpoint likely causal variants underlying genetic association signals. Its resolution can be improved by (i) leveraging information between traits; and (ii) exploiting differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between diverse population groups. Using association summary statistics, MGflashfm jointly fine-maps signals from multiple traits and population groups; MGfm uses an analogous framework to analyse each trait separately. We also provide a practical approach to fine-mapping with out-of-sample reference panels. In simulation studies we show that MGflashfm and MGfm are well-calibrated and that the mean proportion of causal variants with PP > 0.80 is above 0.75 (MGflashfm) and 0.70 (MGfm). In our analysis of four lipids traits across five population groups, MGflashfm gives a median 99% credible set reduction of 10.5% over MGfm. MGflashfm and MGfm only require summary level data, making them very useful fine-mapping tools in consortia efforts where individual-level data cannot be shared."
115,Spatial-linked alignment tool (SLAT) for aligning heterogenous slices,"Spatially resolved omics technologies reveal the spatial organization of cells in various biological systems. Here we propose SLAT (Spatially-Linked Alignment Tool), a graph-based algorithm for efficient and effective alignment of spatial slices. Adopting a graph adversarial matching strategy, SLAT is the first algorithm capable of aligning heterogenous spatial data across distinct technologies and modalities. Systematic benchmarks demonstrate SLAT’s superior precision, robustness, and speed over existing state-of-the-arts. Applications to multiple real-world datasets further show SLAT’s utility in enhancing cell-typing resolution, integrating multiple modalities for regulatory inference, and mapping fine-scale spatial-temporal changes during development. The full SLAT package is available at

116,CamoTSS: analysis of alternative transcription start sites for cellular phenotypes and regulatory patterns from 5' scRNA-seq data,"Five-prime single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been widely employed to profile cellular transcriptomes, however, its power of analysing transcription start sites (TSS) has not been fully utilised. Here, we present a computational method suite, CamoTSS, to precisely identify TSS and quantify its expression by leveraging the cDNA on read 1, which enables effective detection of alternative TSS usage. With various experimental data sets, we have demonstrated that CamoTSS can accurately identify TSS and the detected alternative TSS usages showed strong specificity in different biological processes, including cell types across human organs, the development of human thymus, and cancer conditions. As evidenced in nasopharyngeal cancer, alternative TSS usage can also reveal regulatory patterns including systematic TSS dysregulations."
117,trRosettaRNA: automated prediction of RNA 3D structure with transformer network,"RNA 3D structure prediction is a long-standing challenge. Inspired by the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction, we developed trRosettaRNA, an automated deep learning-based approach to RNA 3D structure prediction. The trRosettaRNA pipeline comprises two major steps: 1D and 2D geometries prediction by a transformer network; and 3D structure folding by energy minimization. Benchmark tests suggest that trRosettaRNA outperforms traditional automated methods. In the blind tests of the 15
th
 Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP15) and the RNA-Puzzles experiments, the automated trRosettaRNA predictions for the natural RNAs are competitive with the top human predictions. trRosettaRNA also outperforms other deep learning-based methods in CASP15 when measured by the Z-score of the Root-Mean-Square Deviation. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to predict accurate structures for synthetic RNAs with an automated approach. We hope this work could be a good start toward solving the hard problem of RNA structure prediction with deep learning."
118,Automated temporalis muscle quantification and growth charts for children through adulthood,"Lean muscle mass (LMM) is an important aspect of human health. Temporalis muscle thickness is a promising LMM marker but has had limited utility due to its unknown normal growth trajectory and reference ranges and lack of standardized measurement. Here, we develop an automated deep learning pipeline to accurately measure temporalis muscle thickness (iTMT) from routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We apply iTMT to 23,876 MRIs of healthy subjects, ages 4 through 35, and generate sex-specific iTMT normal growth charts with percentiles. We find that iTMT was associated with specific physiologic traits, including caloric intake, physical activity, sex hormone levels, and presence of malignancy. We validate iTMT across multiple demographic groups and in children with brain tumors and demonstrate feasibility for individualized longitudinal monitoring. The iTMT pipeline provides unprecedented insights into temporalis muscle growth during human development and enables the use of LMM tracking to inform clinical decision-making."
119,EASTR: Identifying and eliminating systematic alignment errors in multi-exon genes,"Accurate alignment of transcribed RNA to reference genomes is a critical step in the analysis of gene expression, which in turn has broad applications in biomedical research and in the basic sciences. We reveal that widely used splice-aware aligners, such as STAR and HISAT2, can introduce erroneous spliced alignments between repeated sequences, leading to the inclusion of falsely spliced transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. In some cases, the ‘phantom’ introns resulting from these errors make their way into widely-used genome annotation databases. To address this issue, we present EASTR (Emending Alignments of Spliced Transcript Reads), a software tool that detects and removes falsely spliced alignments or transcripts from alignment and annotation files. EASTR improves the accuracy of spliced alignments across diverse species, including human, maize, and 
Arabidopsis thaliana
, by detecting sequence similarity between intron-flanking regions. We demonstrate that applying EASTR before transcript assembly substantially reduces false positive introns, exons, and transcripts, improving the overall accuracy of assembled transcripts. Additionally, we show that EASTR’s application to reference annotation databases can detect and correct likely cases of mis-annotated transcripts."
120,The ECM and tissue architecture are major determinants of early invasion mediated by E-cadherin dysfunction,"Germline mutations of E-cadherin cause Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC), a highly invasive cancer syndrome characterised by the occurrence of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma and lobular breast cancer. In this disease, E-cadherin-defective cells are detected invading the adjacent stroma since very early stages. Although E-cadherin loss is well established as a triggering event, other determinants of the invasive process persist largely unknown. Herein, we develop an experimental strategy that comprises in vitro extrusion assays using E-cadherin mutants associated to HDGC, as well as mathematical models epitomising epithelial dynamics and its interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vitro, we verify that E-cadherin dysfunctional cells detach from the epithelial monolayer and extrude basally into the ECM. Through phase-field modelling we demonstrate that, aside from loss of cell-cell adhesion, increased ECM attachment further raises basal extrusion efficiency. Importantly, by combining phase-field and vertex model simulations, we show that the cylindrical structure of gastric glands strongly promotes the cell’s invasive ability. Moreover, we validate our findings using a dissipative particle dynamics simulation of epithelial extrusion. Overall, we provide the first evidence that cancer cell invasion is the outcome of defective cell-cell linkages, abnormal interplay with the ECM, and a favourable 3D tissue structure."
121,Asymmetric conformations and lipid interactions shape the ATP-coupled cycle of a heterodimeric ABC transporter,"Here we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to capture and characterize ATP- and substrate-bound inward-facing (IF) and occluded (OC) conformational states of the heterodimeric ATP binding cassette (ABC) multidrug exporter BmrCD in lipid nanodiscs. Supported by DEER analysis, the structures reveal that ATP-powered isomerization entails changes in the relative symmetry of the BmrC and BmrD subunits that propagates from the transmembrane domain to the nucleotide binding domain. The structures uncover asymmetric substrate and Mg
2+
 binding which we hypothesize are required for triggering ATP hydrolysis preferentially in one of the nucleotide-binding sites. MD simulations demonstrate that multiple lipid molecules differentially bind the IF versus the OC conformation thus establishing that lipid interactions modulate BmrCD energy landscape. Our findings are framed in a model that highlights the role of asymmetric conformations in the ATP-coupled transport with general implications to the mechanism of ABC transporters."
122,"A single cell genomics atlas of the 
Drosophila
 larval eye reveals distinct photoreceptor developmental timelines","The 
Drosophila
 eye is a powerful model system to study the dynamics of cell differentiation, cell state transitions, cell maturation, and pattern formation. However, a high-resolution single cell genomics resource that accurately profiles all major cell types of the larval eye disc and their spatiotemporal relationships is lacking. Here, we report transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data for all known cell types in the developing eye. Photoreceptors appear as strands of cells that represent their dynamic developmental timelines. As photoreceptor subtypes mature, they appear to assume a common transcriptomic profile that is dominated by genes involved in axon function. We identify cell type maturation genes, enhancers, and potential regulators, as well as genes with distinct R3 or R4 photoreceptor specific expression. Finally, we observe that the chromatin accessibility between cones and photoreceptors is distinct. These single cell genomics atlases will greatly enhance the power of the 
Drosophila
 eye as a model system."
123,Inflammation in the tumor-adjacent lung as a predictor of clinical outcome in lung adenocarcinoma,"Approximately 30% of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients present with disease progression after successful surgical resection. Despite efforts of mapping the genetic landscape, there has been limited success in discovering predictive biomarkers of disease outcomes. Here we performed a systematic multi-omic assessment of 143 tumors and matched tumor-adjacent, histologically-normal lung tissue with long-term patient follow-up. Through histologic, mutational, and transcriptomic profiling of tumor and adjacent-normal tissue, we identified an inflammatory gene signature in tumor-adjacent tissue as the strongest clinical predictor of disease progression. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis demonstrated the progression-associated inflammatory signature was expressed in both immune and non-immune cells, and cell type-specific profiling in monocytes further improved outcome predictions. Additional analyses of tumor-adjacent transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas validated the association of the inflammatory signature with worse outcomes across cancers. Collectively, our study suggests that molecular profiling of tumor-adjacent tissue can identify patients at high risk for disease progression."
124,Speos: an ensemble graph representation learning framework to predict core gene candidates for complex diseases,"Understanding phenotype-to-genotype relationships is a grand challenge of 21st century biology with translational implications. The recently proposed “omnigenic” model postulates that effects of genetic variation on traits are mediated by 
core-
genes and -proteins whose activities mechanistically influence the phenotype, whereas 
peripheral
 genes encode a regulatory network that indirectly affects phenotypes via core gene products. Here, we develop a positive-unlabeled graph representation-learning ensemble-approach based on a nested cross-validation to predict core-like genes for diverse diseases using Mendelian disorder genes for training. Employing mouse knockout phenotypes for external validations, we demonstrate that core-like genes display several key properties of core genes: Mouse knockouts of genes corresponding to our most confident predictions give rise to relevant mouse phenotypes at rates on par with the Mendelian disorder genes, and all candidates exhibit core gene properties like transcriptional deregulation in disease and loss-of-function intolerance. Moreover, as predicted for core genes, our candidates are enriched for drug targets and druggable proteins. In contrast to Mendelian disorder genes the new core-like genes are enriched for druggable yet untargeted gene products, which are therefore attractive targets for drug development. Interpretation of the underlying deep learning model suggests plausible explanations for our core gene predictions in form of molecular mechanisms and physical interactions. Our results demonstrate the potential of graph representation learning for the interpretation of biological complexity and pave the way for studying core gene properties and future drug development."
125,"replicAnt
: a pipeline for generating annotated images of animals in complex environments using Unreal Engine","Deep learning-based computer vision methods are transforming animal behavioural research. Transfer learning has enabled work in non-model species, but still requires hand-annotation of example footage, and is only performant in well-defined conditions. To help overcome these limitations, we developed 
replicAnt
, a configurable pipeline implemented in Unreal Engine 5 and Python, designed to generate large and variable training datasets on consumer-grade hardware. 
replicAnt
 places 3D animal models into complex, procedurally generated environments, from which automatically annotated images can be exported. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated with 
replicAnt
 can significantly reduce the hand-annotation required to achieve benchmark performance in common applications such as animal detection, tracking, pose-estimation, and semantic segmentation. We also show that it increases the subject-specificity and domain-invariance of the trained networks, thereby conferring robustness. In some applications, 
replicAnt
 may even remove the need for hand-annotation altogether. It thus represents a significant step towards porting deep learning-based computer vision tools to the field."
126,NIPMAP: niche-phenotype mapping of multiplex histology data by community ecology,"Advances in multiplex histology allow surveying millions of cells, dozens of cell types, and up to thousands of phenotypes within the spatial context of tissue sections. This leads to a combinatorial challenge in (a) summarizing the cellular and phenotypic architecture of tissues and (b) identifying phenotypes with interesting spatial architecture. To address this, we combine ideas from community ecology and machine learning into niche-phenotype mapping (NIPMAP). NIPMAP takes advantage of geometric constraints on local cellular composition imposed by the niche structure of tissues in order to automatically segment tissue sections into niches and their interfaces. Projecting phenotypes on niches and their interfaces identifies previously-reported and previously-unreported spatially-driven phenotypes, concisely summarizes the phenotypic architecture of tissues, and reveals fundamental properties of tissue architecture. NIPMAP is applicable to both protein and RNA multiplex histology of healthy and diseased tissue. An open-source R/Python package implements NIPMAP."
127,Unappreciated subcontinental admixture in Europeans and European Americans and implications for genetic epidemiology studies,"European-ancestry populations are recognized as stratified but not as admixed, implying that residual confounding by locus-specific ancestry can affect studies of association, polygenic adaptation, and polygenic risk scores. We integrate individual-level genome-wide data from ~19,000 European-ancestry individuals across 79 European populations and five European American cohorts. We generate a new reference panel that captures ancestral diversity missed by both the 1000 Genomes and Human Genome Diversity Projects. Both Europeans and European Americans are admixed at the subcontinental level, with admixture dates differing among subgroups of European Americans. After adjustment for both genome-wide and locus-specific ancestry, associations between a highly differentiated variant in 
LCT
 (rs4988235) and height or LDL-cholesterol were confirmed to be false positives whereas the association between 
LCT
 and body mass index was genuine. We provide formal evidence of subcontinental admixture in individuals with European ancestry, which, if not properly accounted for, can produce spurious results in genetic epidemiology studies."
128,Evolutionary design of explainable algorithms for biomedical image segmentation,"An unresolved issue in contemporary biomedicine is the overwhelming number and diversity of complex images that require annotation, analysis and interpretation. Recent advances in Deep Learning have revolutionized the field of computer vision, creating algorithms that compete with human experts in image segmentation tasks. However, these frameworks require large human-annotated datasets for training and the resulting “black box” models are difficult to interpret. In this study, we introduce 
Kartezio
, a modular Cartesian Genetic Programming-based computational strategy that generates fully transparent and easily interpretable image processing pipelines by iteratively assembling and parameterizing computer vision functions. The pipelines thus generated exhibit comparable precision to state-of-the-art Deep Learning approaches on instance segmentation tasks, while requiring drastically smaller training datasets. This Few-Shot Learning method confers tremendous flexibility, speed, and functionality to this approach. We then deploy Kartezio to solve a series of semantic and instance segmentation problems, and demonstrate its utility across diverse images ranging from multiplexed tissue histopathology images to high resolution microscopy images. While the flexibility, robustness and practical utility of Kartezio make this fully explicable evolutionary designer a potential game-changer in the field of biomedical image processing, Kartezio remains complementary and potentially auxiliary to mainstream Deep Learning approaches."
129,Corvids optimize working memory by categorizing continuous stimuli,"Working memory (WM) is a crucial element of the higher cognition of primates and corvid songbirds. Despite its importance, WM has a severely limited capacity and is vulnerable to noise. In primates, attractor dynamics mitigate the effect of noise by discretizing continuous information. Yet, it remains unclear whether similar dynamics are seen in avian brains. Here, we show jackdaws (
Corvus monedula
) have similar behavioral biases as humans; memories are less precise and more biased as memory demands increase. Model-based analysis reveal discrete attractors are evenly spread across the stimulus space. Altogether, our comparative approach suggests attractor dynamics in primates and corvids mitigate the effect of noise by systematically drifting towards specific attractors. By demonstrating this effect in an evolutionary distant species, our results strengthen attractor dynamics as general, adaptive biological principle to efficiently use WM."
130,sciCSR infers B cell state transition and predicts class-switch recombination dynamics using single-cell transcriptomic data,"Class-switch recombination (CSR) is an integral part of B cell maturation. Here we present sciCSR (pronounced ‘scissor’, single-cell inference of class-switch recombination), a computational pipeline that analyzes CSR events and dynamics of B cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. Validated on both simulated and real data, sciCSR re-analyzes scRNA-seq alignments to differentiate productive heavy-chain immunoglobulin transcripts from germline ‘sterile’ transcripts. From a snapshot of B cell scRNA-seq data, a Markov state model is built to infer the dynamics and direction of CSR. Applying sciCSR on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination time-course scRNA-seq data, we observe that sciCSR predicts, using data from an earlier time point in the collected time-course, the isotype distribution of B cell receptor repertoires of subsequent time points with high accuracy (cosine similarity ~0.9). Using processes specific to B cells, sciCSR identifies transitions that are often missed by conventional RNA velocity analyses and can reveal insights into the dynamics of B cell CSR during immune response."
131,Probabilities of developing HIV-1 bNAb sequence features in uninfected and chronically infected individuals,"HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are able to suppress viremia and prevent infection. Their induction by vaccination is therefore a major goal. However, in contrast to antibodies that neutralize other pathogens, HIV-1-specific bNAbs frequently carry uncommon molecular characteristics that might prevent their induction. Here, we perform unbiased sequence analyses of B cell receptor repertoires from 57 uninfected and 46 chronically HIV-1- or HCV-infected individuals and learn probabilistic models to predict the likelihood of bNAb development. We formally show that lower probabilities for bNAbs are predictive of higher HIV-1 neutralization activity. Moreover, ranking bNAbs by their probabilities allows to identify highly potent antibodies with superior generation probabilities as preferential targets for vaccination approaches. Importantly, we find equal bNAb probabilities across infected and uninfected individuals. This implies that chronic infection is not a prerequisite for the generation of bNAbs, fostering the hope that HIV-1 vaccines can induce bNAb development in uninfected people."
132,A generative adversarial network model alternative to animal studies for clinical pathology assessment,"Animal studies are unavoidable in evaluating chemical and drug safety. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate synthetic animal data by learning from the legacy animal study results, thus may serve as an alternative approach to assess untested chemicals. AnimalGAN, a GAN method to simulate 38 rat clinical pathology measures, was developed with significant robustness even for the drugs that vary significantly from these used during training, both in terms of chemical structure, drug class, and the year of FDA approval. AnimalGAN showed comparable results in hepatotoxicity assessment as using the real animal data and outperformed 12 conventional quantitative structure-activity relationship approaches. Using AnimalGAN, a virtual experiment of 100,000 rats ranked hepatotoxicity of three structurally similar drugs in a similar trend that has been observed in human population. AnimalGAN represented a significant step with artificial intelligence towards the global effort in replacement, reduction, and refinement (3Rs) of animal use."
133,Tracing cancer evolution and heterogeneity using Hi-C,"Chromosomal rearrangements can initiate and drive cancer progression, yet it has been challenging to evaluate their impact, especially in genetically heterogeneous solid cancers. To address this problem we developed HiDENSEC, a new computational framework for analyzing chromatin conformation capture in heterogeneous samples that can infer somatic copy number alterations, characterize large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, and estimate cancer cell fractions. After validating HiDENSEC with in silico and in vitro controls, we used it to characterize chromosome-scale evolution during melanoma progression in formalin-fixed tumor samples from three patients. The resulting comprehensive annotation of the genomic events includes copy number neutral translocations that disrupt tumor suppressor genes such as 
NF1
, whole chromosome arm exchanges that result in loss of 
CDKN2A
, and whole-arm copy-number neutral loss of homozygosity involving 
PTEN
. These findings show that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements occur throughout cancer evolution and that characterizing these events yields insights into drivers of melanoma progression."
134,LensAge index as a deep learning-based biological age for self-monitoring the risks of age-related diseases and mortality,"Age is closely related to human health and disease risks. However, chronologically defined age often disagrees with biological age, primarily due to genetic and environmental variables. Identifying effective indicators for biological age in clinical practice and self-monitoring is important but currently lacking. The human lens accumulates age-related changes that are amenable to rapid and objective assessment. Here, using lens photographs from 20 to 96-year-olds, we develop LensAge to reflect lens aging via deep learning. LensAge is closely correlated with chronological age of relatively healthy individuals (R
2
 > 0.80, mean absolute errors of 4.25 to 4.82 years). Among the general population, we calculate the LensAge index by contrasting LensAge and chronological age to reflect the aging rate relative to peers. The LensAge index effectively reveals the risks of age-related eye and systemic disease occurrence, as well as all-cause mortality. It outperforms chronological age in reflecting age-related disease risks (
p
 < 0.001). More importantly, our models can conveniently work based on smartphone photographs, suggesting suitability for routine self-examination of aging status. Overall, our study demonstrates that the LensAge index may serve as an ideal quantitative indicator for clinically assessing and self-monitoring biological age in humans."
135,Poor sleep and shift work associate with increased blood pressure and inflammation in UK Biobank participants,"Disrupted circadian rhythms have been linked to an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, many studies show inconsistent findings and are not sufficiently powered for targeted subgroup analyses. Using the UK Biobank cohort, we evaluate the association between circadian rhythm-disrupting behaviours, blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and inflammatory markers in >350,000 adults with European white British ancestry. The independent U-shaped relationship between sleep length and SBP/DBP is most prominent with a low inflammatory status. Poor sleep quality and permanent night shift work are also positively associated with SBP/DBP. Although fully adjusting for BMI in the linear regression model attenuated effect sizes, these associations remain significant. Two-sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analyses support a potential causal effect of long sleep, short sleep, chronotype, daytime napping and sleep duration on SBP/DBP. Thus, in the current study, we present a positive association between circadian rhythm-disrupting behaviours and SBP/DBP regulation in males and females that is largely independent of age."
136,Fetal biometry and amniotic fluid volume assessment end-to-end automation using Deep Learning,"Fetal biometry and amniotic fluid volume assessments are two essential yet repetitive tasks in fetal ultrasound screening scans, aiding in the detection of potentially life-threatening conditions. However, these assessment methods can occasionally yield unreliable results. Advances in deep learning have opened up new avenues for automated measurements in fetal ultrasound, demonstrating human-level performance in various fetal ultrasound tasks. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies are retrospective in silico studies, with a limited number including African patients in their datasets. In this study we developed and prospectively assessed the performance of deep learning models for end-to-end automation of fetal biometry and amniotic fluid volume measurements. These models were trained using a newly constructed database of 172,293 de-identified Moroccan fetal ultrasound images, supplemented with publicly available datasets. the models were then tested on prospectively acquired video clips from 172 pregnant people forming a consecutive series gathered at four healthcare centers in Morocco. Our results demonstrate that the 95% limits of agreement between the models and practitioners for the studied measurements were narrower than the reported intra- and inter-observer variability among expert human sonographers for all the parameters under study. This means that these models could be deployed in clinical conditions, to alleviate time-consuming, repetitive tasks, and make fetal ultrasound more accessible in limited-resource environments."
137,Dissecting the human leptomeninges at single-cell resolution,"Emerging evidence shows that the meninges conduct essential immune surveillance and immune defense at the brain border, and the dysfunction of meningeal immunity contributes to aging and neurodegeneration. However, no study exists on the molecular properties of cell types within human leptomeninges. Here, we provide single nuclei profiling of dissected postmortem leptomeninges from aged individuals. We detect diverse cell types, including unique meningeal endothelial, mural, and fibroblast subtypes. For immune cells, we show that most T cells express CD8 and bear characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells. We also identify distinct subtypes of border-associated macrophages (BAMs) that display differential gene expressions from microglia and express risk genes for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), as nominated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We discover cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes in individuals with Alzheimer’s dementia, particularly in fibroblasts and BAMs. Indeed, when cultured, leptomeningeal cells display the signature of ex vivo AD fibroblasts upon amyloid-β treatment. We further explore ligand-receptor interactions within the leptomeningeal niche and computationally infer intercellular communications in AD. Thus, our study establishes a molecular map of human leptomeningeal cell types, providing significant insight into the border immune and fibrotic responses in AD."
138,Causal identification of single-cell experimental perturbation effects with CINEMA-OT,"Recent advancements in single-cell technologies allow characterization of experimental perturbations at single-cell resolution. While methods have been developed to analyze such experiments, the application of a strict causal framework has not yet been explored for the inference of treatment effects at the single-cell level. Here we present a causal-inference-based approach to single-cell perturbation analysis, termed CINEMA-OT (causal independent effect module attribution + optimal transport). CINEMA-OT separates confounding sources of variation from perturbation effects to obtain an optimal transport matching that reflects counterfactual cell pairs. These cell pairs represent causal perturbation responses permitting a number of novel analyses, such as individual treatment-effect analysis, response clustering, attribution analysis, and synergy analysis. We benchmark CINEMA-OT on an array of treatment-effect estimation tasks for several simulated and real datasets and show that it outperforms other single-cell perturbation analysis methods. Finally, we perform CINEMA-OT analysis of two newly generated datasets: (1) rhinovirus and cigarette-smoke-exposed airway organoids, and (2) combinatorial cytokine stimulation of immune cells. In these experiments, CINEMA-OT reveals potential mechanisms by which cigarette-smoke exposure dulls the airway antiviral response, as well as the logic that governs chemokine secretion and peripheral immune cell recruitment."
139,Conformational ensemble-dependent lipid recognition and segregation by prenylated intrinsically disordered regions in small GTPases,"We studied diverse prenylated intrinsically disordered regions (PIDRs) of Ras and Rho family small GTPases using long timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in an asymmetric model membrane of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids. Here we show that conformational plasticity is a key determinant of lipid sorting by polybasic PIDRs and provide evidence for lipid sorting based on both headgroup and acyl chain structures. We further show that conformational ensemble-based lipid recognition is generalizable to all polybasic PIDRs, and that the sequence outside the polybasic domain (PBD) modulates the conformational plasticity, bilayer adsorption, and interactions of PIDRs with membrane lipids. Specifically, we find that palmitoylation, the ratio of basic to acidic residues, and the hydrophobic content of the sequence outside the PBD significantly impact the diversity of conformational substates and hence the extent of conformation-dependent lipid interactions. We thus propose that the PBD is required but not sufficient for the full realization of lipid sorting by prenylated PBD-containing membrane anchors, and that the membrane anchor is not only responsible for high affinity membrane binding but also directs the protein to the right target membrane where it participates in lipid sorting."
140,KMD clustering: robust general-purpose clustering of biological data,"The noisy and high-dimensional nature of biological data has spawned advanced clustering algorithms that are tailored for specific biological datatypes. However, the performance of such methods varies greatly between datasets and they require post hoc tuning of cryptic hyperparameters. We present k minimal distance (KMD) clustering, a general-purpose method based on a generalization of single and average linkage hierarchical clustering. We introduce a generalized silhouette-like function to eliminate the cryptic hyperparameter k, and use sampling to enable application to million-object datasets. Rigorous comparisons to general and specialized clustering methods on simulated, mass cytometry and scRNA-seq datasets show consistent high performance of KMD clustering across all datasets."
141,Domain-PFP allows protein function prediction using function-aware domain embedding representations,"Domains are functional and structural units of proteins that govern various biological functions performed by the proteins. Therefore, the characterization of domains in a protein can serve as a proper functional representation of proteins. Here, we employ a self-supervised protocol to derive functionally consistent representations for domains by learning domain-Gene Ontology (GO) co-occurrences and associations. The domain embeddings we constructed turned out to be effective in performing actual function prediction tasks. Extensive evaluations showed that protein representations using the domain embeddings are superior to those of large-scale protein language models in GO prediction tasks. Moreover, the new function prediction method built on the domain embeddings, named Domain-PFP, substantially outperformed the state-of-the-art function predictors. Additionally, Domain-PFP demonstrated competitive performance in the CAFA3 evaluation, achieving overall the best performance among the top teams that participated in the assessment."
142,Nanopore long-read RNA sequencing reveals functional alternative splicing variants in human vascular smooth muscle cells,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the major contributor to vascular repair and remodeling, which showed high level of phenotypic plasticity. Abnormalities in VSMC plasticity can lead to multiple cardiovascular diseases, wherein alternative splicing plays important roles. However, alternative splicing variants in VSMC plasticity are not fully understood. Here we systematically characterized the long-read transcriptome and their dysregulation in  human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) by employing the Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read RNA sequencing in HASMCs that are separately treated with platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor, and hsa-miR-221-3P transfection. Our analysis reveals frequent alternative splicing events and thousands of unannotated transcripts generated from alternative splicing. HASMCs treated with different factors exhibit distinct transcriptional reprogramming modulated by alternative splicing. We also found that unannotated transcripts produce different open reading frames compared to the annotated transcripts. Finally, we experimentally validated the unannotated transcript derived from gene 
CISD1
, namely 
CISD1-u
, which plays a role in the phenotypic switch of HASMCs. Our study characterizes the phenotypic modulation of HASMCs from an insight of long-read transcriptome, which would promote the understanding and the manipulation of HASMC plasticity in cardiovascular diseases."
143,"Mutual generation in neuronal activity across the brain via deep neural approach, and its network interpretation","In the brain, many regions work in a network-like association, yet it is not known how durable these associations are in terms of activity and could survive without structural connections. To assess the association or similarity between brain regions with a generating approach, this study evaluated the similarity of activities of neurons within each region after disconnecting between regions. The “generation” approach here refers to using a multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to learn the rules of activity generation in one region and then apply that knowledge to generate activity in other regions. Surprisingly, the results revealed that activity generation from one region to disconnected regions was possible with similar accuracy to generation between the same regions in many cases. Notably, firing rates and synchronization of firing between neuron pairs, often used as neuronal representations, could be reproduced with precision. Additionally, accuracies were associated with the relative angle between brain regions and the strength of the structural connections that initially connected them. This outcome enables us to look into trends governing non-uniformity of the cortex based on the potential to generate informative data and reduces the need for animal experiments."
144,Genome-wide association analysis of plasma lipidome identifies 495 genetic associations,"The human plasma lipidome captures risk for cardiometabolic diseases. To discover new lipid-associated variants and understand the link between lipid species and cardiometabolic disorders, we perform univariate and multivariate genome-wide analyses of 179 lipid species in 7174 Finnish individuals. We fine-map the associated loci, prioritize genes, and examine their disease links in 377,277 FinnGen participants. We identify 495 genome-trait associations in 56 genetic loci including 8 novel loci, with a considerable boost provided by the multivariate analysis. For 26 loci, fine-mapping identifies variants with a high causal probability, including 14 coding variants indicating likely causal genes. A phenome-wide analysis across 953 disease endpoints reveals disease associations for 40 lipid loci. For 11 coronary artery disease risk variants, we detect strong associations with lipid species. Our study demonstrates the power of multivariate genetic analysis in correlated lipidomics data and reveals genetic links between diseases and lipid species beyond the standard lipids."
145,Achieving quantitative reproducibility in label-free multisite DIA experiments through multirun alignment,"DIA is a mainstream method for quantitative proteomics, but consistent quantification across multiple LC-MS/MS instruments remains a bottleneck in parallelizing data acquisition. One reason for this inconsistency and missing quantification is the retention time shift which current software does not adequately address for runs from multiple sites. We present multirun chromatogram alignment strategies to map peaks across columns, including the traditional reference-based Star method, and two novel approaches: MST and Progressive alignment. These reference-free strategies produce a quantitatively accurate data-matrix, even from heterogeneous multi-column studies. Progressive alignment also generates merged chromatograms from all runs which has not been previously achieved for LC-MS/MS data. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multirun alignment strategies on a gold-standard annotated dataset, resulting in a threefold reduction in quantitation error-rate compared to non-aligned DIA results. Subsequently, on a multi-species dataset that DIAlignR effectively controls the quantitative error rate, improves precision in protein measurements, and exhibits conservative peak alignment. We next show that the MST alignment reduces cross-site CV by 50% for highly abundant proteins when applied to a dataset from 11 different LC-MS/MS setups. Finally, the reanalysis of 949 plasma runs with multirun alignment revealed a more than 50% increase in insulin resistance (IR) and respiratory viral infection (RVI) proteins, identifying 11 and 13 proteins respectively, compared to prior analysis without it. The three strategies are implemented in our DIAlignR workflow (>2.3) and can be combined with linear, non-linear, or hybrid pairwise alignment."
146,"Proteomics reveal biomarkers for diagnosis, disease activity and long-term disability outcomes in multiple sclerosis","Sensitive and reliable protein biomarkers are needed to predict disease trajectory and personalize treatment strategies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we use the highly sensitive proximity-extension assay combined with next-generation sequencing (Olink Explore) to quantify 1463 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 143 people with early-stage MS and 43 healthy controls. With longitudinally followed discovery and replication cohorts, we identify CSF proteins that consistently predicted both short- and long-term disease progression. Lower levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF is superior in predicting the absence of disease activity two years after sampling (replication AUC = 0.77) compared to all other tested proteins. Importantly, we also identify a combination of 11 CSF proteins (CXCL13, LTA, FCN2, ICAM3, LY9, SLAMF7, TYMP, CHI3L1, FYB1, TNFRSF1B and NfL) that predict the severity of disability worsening according to the normalized age-related MS severity score (replication AUC = 0.90). The identification of these proteins may help elucidate pathogenetic processes and might aid decisions on treatment strategies for persons with MS."
147,Isoform-resolved transcriptome of the human preimplantation embryo,"Human preimplantation development involves extensive remodeling of RNA expression and splicing. However, its transcriptome has been compiled using short-read sequencing data, which fails to capture most full-length mRNAs. Here, we generate an isoform-resolved transcriptome of early human development by performing long- and short-read RNA sequencing on 73 embryos spanning the zygote to blastocyst stages. We identify 110,212 unannotated isoforms transcribed from known genes, including highly conserved protein-coding loci and key developmental regulators. We further identify 17,964 isoforms from 5,239 unannotated genes, which are largely non-coding, primate-specific, and highly associated with transposable elements. These isoforms are widely supported by the integration of published multi-omics datasets, including single-cell 8CLC and blastoid studies. Alternative splicing and gene co-expression network analyses further reveal that embryonic genome activation is associated with splicing disruption and transient upregulation of gene modules. Together, these findings show that the human embryo transcriptome is far more complex than currently known, and will act as a valuable resource to empower future studies exploring development."
148,XMAP: Cross-population fine-mapping by leveraging genetic diversity and accounting for confounding bias,"Fine-mapping prioritizes risk variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs), serving as a critical step to uncover biological mechanisms underlying complex traits. However, several major challenges still remain for existing fine-mapping methods. First, the strong linkage disequilibrium among variants can limit the statistical power and resolution of fine-mapping. Second, it is computationally expensive to simultaneously search for multiple causal variants. Third, the confounding bias hidden in GWAS summary statistics can produce spurious signals. To address these challenges, we develop a statistical method for cross-population fine-mapping (XMAP) by leveraging genetic diversity and accounting for confounding bias. By using cross-population GWAS summary statistics from global biobanks and genomic consortia, we show that XMAP can achieve greater statistical power, better control of false positive rate, and substantially higher computational efficiency for identifying multiple causal signals, compared to existing methods. Importantly, we show that the output of XMAP can be integrated with single-cell datasets, which greatly improves the interpretation of putative causal variants in their cellular context at single-cell resolution."
149,Topological links in predicted protein complex structures reveal limitations of AlphaFold,"AlphaFold is making great progress in protein structure prediction, not only for single-chain proteins but also for multi-chain protein complexes. When using AlphaFold-Multimer to predict protein‒protein complexes, we observed some unusual structures in which chains are looped around each other to form topologically intertwining links at the interface. Based on physical principles, such topological links should generally not exist in native protein complex structures unless covalent modifications of residues are involved. Although it is well known and has been well studied that protein structures may have topologically complex shapes such as knots and links, existing methods are hampered by the chain closure problem and show poor performance in identifying topologically linked structures in protein‒protein complexes. Therefore, we address the chain closure problem by using sliding windows from a local perspective and propose an algorithm to measure the topological–geometric features that can be used to identify topologically linked structures. An application of the method to AlphaFold-Multimer-predicted protein complex structures finds that approximately 1.72% of the predicted structures contain topological links. The method presented in this work will facilitate the computational study of protein‒protein interactions and help further improve the structural prediction of multi-chain protein complexes."
150,"Systematic analysis of paralogous regions in 41,755 exomes uncovers clinically relevant variation","The short lengths of short-read sequencing reads challenge the analysis of paralogous genomic regions in exome and genome sequencing data. Most genetic variants within these homologous regions therefore remain unidentified in standard analyses. Here, we present a method (Chameleolyser) that accurately identifies single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions (SNVs/Indels), copy number variants and ectopic gene conversion events in duplicated genomic regions using whole-exome sequencing data. Application to a cohort of 41,755 exome samples yields 20,432 rare homozygous deletions and 2,529,791 rare SNVs/Indels, of which we show that 338,084 are due to gene conversion events. None of the SNVs/Indels are detectable using regular analysis techniques. Validation by high-fidelity long-read sequencing in 20 samples confirms >88% of called variants. Focusing on variation in known disease genes leads to a direct molecular diagnosis in 25 previously undiagnosed patients. Our method can readily be applied to existing exome data."
151,Dynamic characterization and interpretation for protein-RNA interactions across diverse cellular conditions using HDRNet,"RNA-binding proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression, and understanding the interactions between RNAs and RBPs in distinct cellular conditions forms the basis for comprehending the underlying RNA function. However, current computational methods pose challenges to the cross-prediction of RNA-protein binding events across diverse cell lines and tissue contexts. Here, we develop HDRNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based framework to precisely predict dynamic RBP binding events under diverse cellular conditions. Our results demonstrate that HDRNet can accurately and efficiently identify binding sites, particularly for dynamic prediction, outperforming other state-of-the-art models on 261 linear RNA datasets from both eCLIP and CLIP-seq, supplemented with additional tissue data. Moreover, we conduct motif and interpretation analyses to provide fresh insights into the pathological mechanisms underlying RNA-RBP interactions from various perspectives. Our functional genomic analysis further explores the gene-human disease associations, uncovering previously uncharacterized observations for a broad range of genetic disorders."
152,nextPYP: a comprehensive and scalable platform for characterizing protein variability in situ using single-particle cryo-electron tomography,"Single-particle cryo-electron tomography is an emerging technique capable of determining the structure of proteins imaged within the native context of cells at molecular resolution. While high-throughput techniques for sample preparation and tilt-series acquisition are beginning to provide sufficient data to allow structural studies of proteins at physiological concentrations, the complex data analysis pipeline and the demanding storage and computational requirements pose major barriers for the development and broader adoption of this technology. Here, we present a scalable, end-to-end framework for single-particle cryo-electron tomography data analysis from on-the-fly pre-processing of tilt series to high-resolution refinement and classification, which allows efficient analysis and visualization of datasets with hundreds of tilt series and hundreds of thousands of particles. We validate our approach using in vitro and cellular datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at achieving high-resolution and revealing conformational heterogeneity in situ. The framework is made available through an intuitive and easy-to-use computer application, nextPYP (

153,Enzymatic synthesis and nanopore sequencing of 12-letter supernumerary DNA,"The 4-letter DNA alphabet (A, T, G, C) as found in Nature is an elegant, yet non-exhaustive solution to the problem of storage, transfer, and evolution of biological information. Here, we report on strategies for both writing and reading DNA with expanded alphabets composed of up to 12 letters (A, T, G, C, B, S, P, Z, X, K, J, V). For writing, we devise an enzymatic strategy for inserting a singular, orthogonal xenonucleic acid (XNA) base pair into standard DNA sequences using 2′-deoxy-xenonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Integrating this strategy with combinatorial oligos generated on a chip, we construct libraries containing single XNA bases for parameterizing kmer basecalling models for commercially available nanopore sequencing. These elementary steps are combined to synthesize and sequence DNA containing 12 letters – the upper limit of what is accessible within the electroneutral, canonical base pairing framework. By introducing low-barrier synthesis and sequencing strategies, this work overcomes previous obstacles paving the way for making expanded alphabets widely accessible."
154,Systematic review and integrated data analysis reveal diverse pangolin-associated microbes with infection potential,"There has been increasing global concern about the spillover transmission of pangolin-associated microbes. To assess the risk of these microbes for emergence as human pathogens, we integrated data from multiple sources to describe the distribution and spectrum of microbes harbored by pangolins. Wild and trafficked pangolins have been mainly recorded in Asia and Africa, while captive pangolins have been reported in European and North American countries. A total of 128 microbes, including 92 viruses, 25 bacteria, eight protists, and three uncharacterized microbes, have been identified in five pangolin species. Out of 128 pangolin-associated microbes, 31 (including 13 viruses, 15 bacteria, and three protists) have been reported in humans, and 54 are animal-associated viruses. The phylogenetic analysis of human-associated viruses carried by pangolins reveals that they are genetically close to those naturally circulating among human populations in the world. Pangolins harbor diverse microbes, many of which have been previously reported in humans and animals. Abundant viruses initially detected in pangolins might exhibit risks for spillover transmission."
155,SaLT&PepPr is an interface-predicting language model for designing peptide-guided protein degraders,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are critical for biological processes and predicting the sites of these interactions is useful for both computational and experimental applications. We present a

T

Pr
ioritization (SaLT&PepPr) pipeline to predict interaction interfaces from a protein sequence alone for the subsequent generation of peptidic binding motifs. Our model fine-tunes the ESM-2 protein language model (pLM) with a per-position prediction task to identify PPI sites using data from the PDB, and prioritizes motifs which are most likely to be involved within inter-chain binding. By only using amino acid sequence as input, our model is competitive with structural homology-based methods, but exhibits reduced performance compared with deep learning models that input both structural and sequence features. Inspired by our previous results using co-crystals to engineer target-binding “guide” peptides, we curate PPI databases to identify partners for subsequent peptide derivation. Fusing guide peptides to an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, we demonstrate degradation of endogenous β-catenin, 4E-BP2, and TRIM8, and highlight the nanomolar binding affinity, low off-targeting propensity, and function-altering capability of our best-performing degraders in cancer cells. In total, our study suggests that prioritizing binders from natural interactions via pLMs can enable programmable protein targeting and modulation."
156,De novo design of knotted tandem repeat proteins,"De novo protein design methods can create proteins with folds not yet seen in nature. These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3
1
) and pentafoil (5
1
) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (
N
 = 3 repeats for the trefoil and 
N
 = 5 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein’s structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology. Our results also provide insights into the folding of knotted proteins."
157,A deep population reference panel of tandem repeat variation,"Tandem repeats (TRs) represent one of the largest sources of genetic variation in humans and are implicated in a range of phenotypes. Here we present a deep characterization of TR variation based on high coverage whole genome sequencing from 3550 diverse individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project and H3Africa cohorts. We develop a method, EnsembleTR, to integrate genotypes from four separate methods resulting in high-quality genotypes at more than 1.7 million TR loci. Our catalog reveals novel sequence features influencing TR heterozygosity, identifies population-specific trinucleotide expansions, and finds hundreds of novel eQTL signals. Finally, we generate a phased haplotype panel which can be used to impute most TRs from nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high accuracy. Overall, the TR genotypes and reference haplotype panel generated here will serve as valuable resources for future genome-wide and population-wide studies of TRs and their role in human phenotypes."
158,Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis is mediated by polyfunctional lymphocytes and is dependent on an IL23/IFNγ axis,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) are a relatively newly licenced cancer treatment, which make a once previously untreatable disease now amenable to a potential cure. Combination regimens of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 show enhanced efficacy but are prone to off-target immune-mediated tissue injury, particularly at the barrier surfaces. To probe the impact of immune checkpoints on intestinal homoeostasis, mice are challenged with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. The immune profile of the colon of these mice with CPI-colitis is analysed using bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry. CPI-colitis in mice is dependent on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and by the induction of lymphocytes expressing interferon-γ (IFNγ), cytotoxicity molecules and other pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. This pre-clinical model of CPI-colitis could be attenuated following blockade of the IL23/IFNγ axis. Therapeutic targeting of IFNγ-producing lymphocytes or regulatory networks, may hold the key to reversing CPI-colitis."
159,"A genomic appraisal of invasive 
Salmonella
 Typhimurium and associated antibiotic resistance in sub-Saharan Africa","Invasive non-typhoidal 
Salmonella
 (iNTS) disease manifesting as bloodstream infection with high mortality is responsible for a huge public health burden in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Salmonella enterica
 serovar Typhimurium (
S
. Typhimurium) is the main cause of iNTS disease in Africa. By analysing whole genome sequence data from 1303 
S
. Typhimurium isolates originating from 19 African countries and isolated between 1979 and 2017, here we show a thorough scaled appraisal of the population structure of iNTS disease caused by 
S

S
. Typhimurium clades have already emerged, with ST313 lineage 2 or ST313-L2 driving the current pandemic. ST313-L2 likely emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo around 1980 and further spread in the mid 1990s. We observed plasmid-borne as well as chromosomally encoded fluoroquinolone resistance underlying emergences of extensive-drug and pan-drug resistance. Our work provides an overview of the evolution of invasive 
S

160,Adversarial and variational autoencoders improve metagenomic binning,"Assembly of reads from metagenomic samples is a hard problem, often resulting in highly fragmented genome assemblies. Metagenomic binning allows us to reconstruct genomes by re-grouping the sequences by their organism of origin, thus representing a crucial processing step when exploring the biological diversity of metagenomic samples. Here we present Adversarial Autoencoders for Metagenomics Binning (AAMB), an ensemble deep learning approach that integrates sequence co-abundances and tetranucleotide frequencies into a common denoised space that enables precise clustering of sequences into microbial genomes. When benchmarked, AAMB presented similar or better results compared with the state-of-the-art reference-free binner VAMB, reconstructing ~7% more near-complete (NC) genomes across simulated and real data. In addition, genomes reconstructed using AAMB had higher completeness and greater taxonomic diversity compared with VAMB. Finally, we implemented a pipeline Integrating VAMB and AAMB that enabled improved binning, recovering 20% and 29% more simulated and real NC genomes, respectively, compared to VAMB, with moderate additional runtime."
161,De novo genome assembly depicts the immune genomic characteristics of cattle,"Immunogenomic loci remain poorly understood because of their genetic complexity and size. Here, we report the de novo assembly of a cattle genome and provide a detailed annotation of the immunogenomic loci. The assembled genome contains 143 contigs (N50 ~ 74.0 Mb). In contrast to the current reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2), 156 gaps are closed and 467 scaffolds are located in our assembly. Importantly, the immunogenomic regions, including three immunoglobulin (IG) loci, four T-cell receptor (TR) loci, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, are seamlessly assembled and precisely annotated. With the characterization of 258 IG genes and 657 TR genes distributed across seven genomic loci, we present a detailed depiction of immune gene diversity in cattle. Moreover, the MHC gene structures are integrally revealed with properly phased haplotypes. Together, our work describes a more complete cattle genome, and provides a comprehensive view of its complex immune-genome."
162,Ligand activation mechanisms of human KCNQ2 channel,"The human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ2/KCNQ3 carries the neuronal M-current, which helps to stabilize the membrane potential. KCNQ2 can be activated by analgesics and antiepileptic drugs but their activation mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human KCNQ2-CaM in complex with three activators, namely the antiepileptic drug cannabidiol (CBD), the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP
2
), and HN37 (pynegabine), an antiepileptic drug in the clinical trial, in an either closed or open conformation. The activator-bound structures, along with electrophysiology analyses, reveal the binding modes of two CBD, one PIP
2
, and two HN37 molecules in each KCNQ2 subunit, and elucidate their activation mechanisms on the KCNQ2 channel. These structures may guide the development of antiepileptic drugs and analgesics that target KCNQ2."
163,Accurate prediction of protein folding mechanisms by simple structure-based statistical mechanical models,"Recent breakthroughs in highly accurate protein structure prediction using deep neural networks have made considerable progress in solving the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’. However, predicting detailed mechanisms of how proteins fold into specific native structures remains challenging, especially for multidomain proteins constituting most of the proteomes. Here, we develop a simple structure-based statistical mechanical model that introduces nonlocal interactions driving the folding of multidomain proteins. Our model successfully predicts protein folding processes consistent with experiments, without the limitations of protein size and shape. Furthermore, slight modifications of the model allow prediction of disulfide-oxidative and disulfide-intact protein folding. These predictions depict details of the folding processes beyond reproducing experimental results and provide a rationale for the folding mechanisms. Thus, our physics-based models enable accurate prediction of protein folding mechanisms with low computational complexity, paving the way for solving the folding process component of the ‘protein folding problem’."
164,Form factor determination of biological molecules with X-ray free electron laser small-angle scattering (XFEL-SAS),"Free-electron lasers (FEL) are revolutionizing X-ray-based structural biology methods. While protein crystallography is already routinely performed at FELs, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) studies of biological macromolecules are not as prevalent. SAXS allows the study of the shape and overall structure of proteins and nucleic acids in solution, in a quasi-native environment. In solution, chemical and biophysical parameters that have an influence on the structure and dynamics of molecules can be varied and their effect on conformational changes can be monitored in time-resolved XFEL and SAXS experiments. We report here the collection of scattering form factors of proteins in solution using FEL X-rays. The form factors correspond to the scattering signal of the protein ensemble alone; the scattering contributions from the solvent and the instrument are separately measured and accurately subtracted. The experiment was done using a liquid jet for sample delivery. These results pave the way for time-resolved studies and measurements from dilute samples, capitalizing on the intense and short FEL X-ray pulses."
165,NeST: nested hierarchical structure identification in spatial transcriptomic data,"Spatial gene expression in tissue is characterized by regions in which particular genes are enriched or depleted. Frequently, these regions contain nested inside them subregions with distinct expression patterns. Segmentation methods in spatial transcriptomic (ST) data extract disjoint regions maximizing similarity over the greatest number of genes, typically on a particular spatial scale, thus lacking the ability to find region-within-region structure. We present NeST, which extracts spatial structure through coexpression hotspots—regions exhibiting localized spatial coexpression of some set of genes. Coexpression hotspots identify structure on any spatial scale, over any possible subset of genes, and are highly explainable. NeST also performs spatial analysis of cell-cell interactions via ligand-receptor, identifying active areas de novo without restriction of cell type or other groupings, in both two and three dimensions. Through application on ST datasets of varying type and resolution, we demonstrate the ability of NeST to reveal a new level of biological structure."
166,Identification of errors in draft genome assemblies at single-nucleotide resolution for quality assessment and improvement,"Assembly of a high-quality genome is important for downstream comparative and functional genomic studies. However, most tools for genome assembly assessment only give qualitative reports, which do not pinpoint assembly errors at specific regions. Here, we develop a new reference-free tool, Clipping information for Revealing Assembly Quality (CRAQ), which maps raw reads back to assembled sequences to identify regional and structural assembly errors based on effective clipped alignment information. Error counts are transformed into corresponding assembly evaluation indexes to reflect the assembly quality at single-nucleotide resolution. Notably, CRAQ distinguishes assembly errors from heterozygous sites or structural differences between haplotypes. This tool can clearly indicate low-quality regions and potential structural error breakpoints; thus, it can identify misjoined regions that should be split for further scaffold building and improvement of the assembly. We have benchmarked CRAQ on multiple genomes assembled using different strategies, and demonstrated the misjoin correction for improving the constructed pseudomolecules."
167,Streamlined structure determination by cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging using TomoBEAR,"Structures of macromolecules in their native state provide unique unambiguous insights into their functions. Cryo-electron tomography combined with subtomogram averaging demonstrated the power to solve such structures in situ at resolutions in the range of 3 Angstrom for some macromolecules. In order to be applicable to the structural determination of the majority of macromolecules observable in cells in limited amounts, processing of tomographic data has to be performed in a high-throughput manner. Here we present TomoBEAR—a modular configurable workflow engine for streamlined processing of cryo-electron tomographic data for subtomogram averaging. TomoBEAR combines commonly used cryo-EM packages with reasonable presets to provide a transparent (“white box”) approach for data management and processing. We demonstrate applications of TomoBEAR to two data sets of purified macromolecular targets, to an ion channel RyR1 in a membrane, and the tomograms of plasma FIB-milled lamellae and demonstrate the ability to produce high-resolution structures. TomoBEAR speeds up data processing, minimizes human interventions, and will help accelerate the adoption of in situ structural biology by cryo-ET. The source code and the documentation are freely available."
168,Expanding PROTACtable genome universe of E3 ligases,"Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) and other targeted protein degradation (TPD) molecules that induce degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) offer new opportunities to engage targets that remain challenging to be inhibited by conventional small molecules. One fundamental element in the degradation process is the E3 ligase. However, less than 2% amongst hundreds of E3 ligases in the human genome have been engaged in current studies in the TPD field, calling for the recruiting of additional ones to further enhance the therapeutic potential of TPD. To accelerate the development of PROTACs utilizing under-explored E3 ligases, we systematically characterize E3 ligases from seven different aspects, including chemical ligandability, expression patterns, protein-protein interactions (PPI), structure availability, functional essentiality, cellular location, and PPI interface by analyzing 30 large-scale data sets. Our analysis uncovers several E3 ligases as promising extant PROTACs. In total, combining confidence score, ligandability, expression pattern, and PPI, we identified 76 E3 ligases as PROTAC-interacting candidates. We develop a user-friendly and flexible web portal (
https://hanlaboratory.com/E3Atlas/
) aimed at assisting researchers to rapidly identify E3 ligases with promising TPD activities against specifically desired targets, facilitating the development of these therapies in cancer and beyond."
169,"Design, structure and plasma binding of ancestral β-CoV scaffold antigens","We report the application of ancestral sequence reconstruction on coronavirus spike protein, resulting in stable and highly soluble ancestral scaffold antigens (AnSAs). The AnSAs interact with plasma of patients recovered from COVID-19 but do not bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Cryo-EM analysis of the AnSAs yield high resolution structures (2.6–2.8 Å) indicating a closed pre-fusion conformation in which all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) are facing downwards. The structures reveal an intricate hydrogen-bonding network mediated by well-resolved loops, both within and across monomers, tethering the N-terminal domain and RBD together. We show that AnSA-5 can induce and boost a broad-spectrum immune response against the wild-type RBD as well as circulating variants of concern in an immune organoid model derived from tonsils. Finally, we highlight how AnSAs are potent scaffolds by replacing the ancestral RBD with the wild-type sequence, which restores ACE2 binding and increases the interaction with convalescent plasma."
170,Genome-wide analysis of the interplay between chromatin-associated RNA and 3D genome organization in human cells,"The interphase genome is dynamically organized in the nucleus and decorated with chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA). It remains unclear whether the genome architecture modulates the spatial distribution of caRNA and vice versa. Here, we generate a resource of genome-wide RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA contact maps in human cells. These maps reveal the chromosomal domains demarcated by locally transcribed RNA, hereafter termed RNA-defined chromosomal domains. Further, the spreading of caRNA is constrained by the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs), demonstrating the role of the 3D genome structure in modulating the spatial distribution of RNA. Conversely, stopping transcription or acute depletion of RNA induces thousands of chromatin loops genome-wide. Activation or suppression of the transcription of specific genes suppresses or creates chromatin loops straddling these genes. Deletion of a specific caRNA-producing genomic sequence promotes chromatin loops that straddle the interchromosomal target sequences of this caRNA. These data suggest a feedback loop where the 3D genome modulates the spatial distribution of RNA, which in turn affects the dynamic 3D genome organization."
171,Benchmarking strategies for cross-species integration of single-cell RNA sequencing data,"The growing number of available single-cell gene expression datasets from different species creates opportunities to explore evolutionary relationships between cell types across species. Cross-species integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data has been particularly informative in this context. However, in order to do so robustly it is essential to have rigorous benchmarking and appropriate guidelines to ensure that integration results truly reflect biology. Here, we benchmark 28 combinations of gene homology mapping methods and data integration algorithms in a variety of biological settings. We examine the capability of each strategy to perform species-mixing of known homologous cell types and to preserve biological heterogeneity using 9 established metrics. We also develop a new biology conservation metric to address the maintenance of cell type distinguishability. Overall, scANVI, scVI and SeuratV4 methods achieve a balance between species-mixing and biology conservation. For evolutionarily distant species, including in-paralogs is beneficial. SAMap outperforms when integrating whole-body atlases between species with challenging gene homology annotation. We provide our freely available cross-species integration and assessment pipeline to help analyse new data and develop new algorithms."
172,Rewiring of the promoter-enhancer interactome and regulatory landscape in glioblastoma orchestrates gene expression underlying neurogliomal synaptic communication,"Chromatin organization controls transcription by modulating 3D-interactions between enhancers and promoters in the nucleus. Alterations in epigenetic states and 3D-chromatin organization result in gene expression changes contributing to cancer. Here, we map the promoter-enhancer interactome and regulatory landscape of glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumour. Our data reveals profound rewiring of promoter-enhancer interactions, chromatin accessibility and redistribution of histone marks in glioblastoma. This leads to loss of long-range regulatory interactions and overall activation of promoters, which orchestrate changes in the expression of genes associated to glutamatergic synapses, axon guidance, axonogenesis and chromatin remodelling. SMAD3 and PITX1 emerge as major transcription factors controlling genes related to synapse organization and axon guidance. Inhibition of SMAD3 and neuronal activity stimulation cooperate to promote proliferation of glioblastoma cells in co-culture with glutamatergic neurons, and in mice bearing patient-derived xenografts. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the regulatory networks that mediate neurogliomal synaptic communication."
173,A systematic study of key elements underlying molecular property prediction,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied in drug discovery with a major task as molecular property prediction. Despite booming techniques in molecular representation learning, key elements underlying molecular property prediction remain largely unexplored, which impedes further advancements in this field. Herein, we conduct an extensive evaluation of representative models using various representations on the MoleculeNet datasets, a suite of opioids-related datasets and two additional activity datasets from the literature. To investigate the predictive power in low-data and high-data space, a series of descriptors datasets of varying sizes are also assembled to evaluate the models. In total, we have trained 62,820 models, including 50,220 models on fixed representations, 4200 models on SMILES sequences and 8400 models on molecular graphs. Based on extensive experimentation and rigorous comparison, we show that representation learning models exhibit limited performance in molecular property prediction in most datasets. Besides, multiple key elements underlying molecular property prediction can affect the evaluation results. Furthermore, we show that activity cliffs can significantly impact model prediction. Finally, we explore into potential causes why representation learning models can fail and show that dataset size is essential for representation learning models to excel."
174,Comprehensive benchmarking and guidelines of mosaic variant calling strategies,"Rapid advances in sequencing and analysis technologies have enabled the accurate detection of diverse forms of genomic variants represented as heterozygous, homozygous and mosaic mutations. However, the best practices for mosaic variant calling remain disorganized owing to the technical and conceptual difficulties faced in evaluation. Here we present our benchmark of 11 feasible mosaic variant detection approaches based on a systematically designed whole-exome-level reference standard that mimics mosaic samples, supported by 354,258 control positive mosaic single-nucleotide variants and insertion-deletion mutations and 33,111,725 control negatives. We identified not only the best practice for mosaic variant detection but also the condition-dependent strengths and weaknesses of the current methods. Furthermore, feature-level evaluation and their combinatorial usage across multiple algorithms direct the way for immediate to prolonged improvements in mosaic variant detection. Our results will guide researchers in selecting suitable calling algorithms and suggest future strategies for developers."
175,Simulation of undiagnosed patients with novel genetic conditions,"Rare Mendelian disorders pose a major diagnostic challenge and collectively affect 300–400 million patients worldwide. Many automated tools aim to uncover causal genes in patients with suspected genetic disorders, but evaluation of these tools is limited due to the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets that include previously unpublished conditions. Here, we present a computational pipeline that simulates realistic clinical datasets to address this deficit. Our framework jointly simulates complex phenotypes and challenging candidate genes and produces patients with novel genetic conditions. We demonstrate the similarity of our simulated patients to real patients from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and evaluate common gene prioritization methods on the simulated cohort. These prioritization methods recover known gene-disease associations but perform poorly on diagnosing patients with novel genetic disorders. Our publicly-available dataset and codebase can be utilized by medical genetics researchers to evaluate, compare, and improve tools that aid in the diagnostic process."
176,Structural basis of promiscuous substrate transport by Organic Cation Transporter 1,"Organic Cation Transporter 1 (OCT1) plays a crucial role in hepatic metabolism by mediating the uptake of a range of metabolites and drugs. Genetic variations can alter the efficacy and safety of compounds transported by OCT1, such as those used for cardiovascular, oncological, and psychological indications. Despite its importance in drug pharmacokinetics, the substrate selectivity and underlying structural mechanisms of OCT1 remain poorly understood. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of full-length human OCT1 in the inward-open conformation, both ligand-free and drug-bound, indicating the basis for its broad substrate recognition. Comparison of our structures with those of outward-open OCTs provides molecular insight into the alternating access mechanism of OCTs. We observe that hydrophobic gates stabilize the inward-facing conformation, whereas charge neutralization in the binding pocket facilitates the release of cationic substrates. These findings provide a framework for understanding the structural basis of the promiscuity of drug binding and substrate translocation in OCT1."
177,Revealing invisible cell phenotypes with conditional generative modeling,"Biological sciences, drug discovery and medicine rely heavily on cell phenotype perturbation and microscope observation. However, most cellular phenotypic changes are subtle and thus hidden from us by natural cell variability: two cells in the same condition already look different. In this study, we show that conditional generative models can be used to transform an image of cells from any one condition to another, thus canceling cell variability. We visually and quantitatively validate that the principle of synthetic cell perturbation works on discernible cases. We then illustrate its effectiveness in displaying otherwise invisible cell phenotypes triggered by blood cells under parasite infection, or by the presence of a disease-causing pathological mutation in differentiated neurons derived from iPSCs, or by low concentration drug treatments. The proposed approach, easy to use and robust, opens the door to more accessible discovery of biological and disease biomarkers."
178,Neuropathologist-level integrated classification of adult-type diffuse gliomas using deep learning from whole-slide pathological images,"Current diagnosis of glioma types requires combining both histological features and molecular characteristics, which is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. Determining the tumor types directly from whole-slide images (WSIs) is of great value for glioma diagnosis. This study presents an integrated diagnosis model for automatic classification of diffuse gliomas from annotation-free standard WSIs. Our model is developed on a training cohort (
n
 = 1362) and a validation cohort (
n
 = 340), and tested on an internal testing cohort (
n
 = 289) and two external cohorts (
n
 = 305 and 328, respectively). The model can learn imaging features containing both pathological morphology and underlying biological clues to achieve the integrated diagnosis. Our model achieves high performance with area under receiver operator curve all above 0.90 in classifying major tumor types, in identifying tumor grades within type, and especially in distinguishing tumor genotypes with shared histological features. This integrated diagnosis model has the potential to be used in clinical scenarios for automated and unbiased classification of adult-type diffuse gliomas."
179,HLA3DB: comprehensive annotation of peptide/HLA complexes enables blind structure prediction of T cell epitopes,"The class I proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) display epitopic peptides derived from endogenous proteins on the cell surface for immune surveillance. Accurate modeling of peptides bound to the human MHC, HLA, has been mired by conformational diversity of the central peptide residues, which are critical for recognition by T cell receptors. Here, analysis of X-ray crystal structures within our curated database (HLA3DB) shows that pHLA complexes encompassing multiple HLA allotypes present a discrete set of peptide backbone conformations. Leveraging these backbones, we employ a regression model trained on terms of a physically relevant energy function to develop a comparative modeling approach for nonamer pHLA structures named RepPred. Our method outperforms the top pHLA modeling approach by up to 19% in structural accuracy, and consistently predicts blind targets not included in our training set. Insights from our work may be applied towards predicting antigen immunogenicity, and receptor cross-reactivity."
180,Population-level integration of single-cell datasets enables multi-scale analysis across samples,"The increasing generation of population-level single-cell atlases has the potential to link sample metadata with cellular data. Constructing such references requires integration of heterogeneous cohorts with varying metadata. Here we present single-cell population level integration (scPoli), an open-world learner that incorporates generative models to learn sample and cell representations for data integration, label transfer and reference mapping. We applied scPoli on population-level atlases of lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the latter consisting of 7.8 million cells across 2,375 samples. We demonstrate that scPoli can explain sample-level biological and technical variations using sample embeddings revealing genes associated with batch effects and biological effects. scPoli is further applicable to single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and cross-species datasets, offering insights into chromatin accessibility and comparative genomics. We envision scPoli becoming an important tool for population-level single-cell data integration facilitating atlas use but also interpretation by means of multi-scale analyses."
181,OPUS-DSD: deep structural disentanglement for cryo-EM single-particle analysis,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) captures snapshots of dynamic macromolecules, collectively illustrating the involved structural landscapes. This provides an exciting opportunity to explore the structural variations of macromolecules under study. However, traditional cryo-EM single-particle analysis often yields static structures. Here we describe OPUS-DSD, an algorithm capable of efficiently reconstructing the structural landscape embedded in cryo-EM data. OPUS-DSD uses a three-dimensional convolutional encoder–decoder architecture trained with cryo-EM images, thereby encoding structural variations into a smooth and easily analyzable low-dimension space. This space can be traversed to reconstruct continuous dynamics or clustered to identify distinct conformations. OPUS-DSD can offer meaningful insights into the structural variations of macromolecules, filling in the gaps left by traditional cryo-EM structural determination, and potentially improves the reconstruction resolution by reliably clustering similar particles within the dataset. These functionalities are especially relevant to the study of highly dynamic biological systems. OPUS-DSD is available at

182,Deep flanking sequence engineering for efficient promoter design using DeepSEED,"Designing promoters with desirable properties is essential in synthetic biology. Human experts are skilled at identifying strong explicit patterns in small samples, while deep learning models excel at detecting implicit weak patterns in large datasets. Biologists have described the sequence patterns of promoters via transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). However, the flanking sequences of cis-regulatory elements, have long been overlooked and often arbitrarily decided in promoter design. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepSEED, an AI-aided framework that efficiently designs synthetic promoters by combining expert knowledge with deep learning techniques. DeepSEED has demonstrated success in improving the properties of 
Escherichia coli
 constitutive, IPTG-inducible, and mammalian cell doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoters. Furthermore, our results show that DeepSEED captures the implicit features in flanking sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and DNA shape features, which are crucial for determining promoter properties."
183,Single-cell allele-specific expression analysis reveals dynamic and cell-type-specific regulatory effects,"Differential allele-specific expression (ASE) is a powerful tool to study context-specific cis-regulation of gene expression. Such effects can reflect the interaction between genetic or epigenetic factors and a measured context or condition. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows the measurement of ASE at individual-cell resolution, but there is a lack of statistical methods to analyze such data. We present Differential Allelic Expression using Single-Cell data (DAESC), a powerful method for differential ASE analysis using scRNA-seq from multiple individuals, with statistical behavior confirmed through simulation. DAESC accounts for non-independence between cells from the same individual and incorporates implicit haplotype phasing. Application to data from 105 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines identifies 657 genes dynamically regulated during endoderm differentiation, with enrichment for changes in chromatin state. Application to a type-2 diabetes dataset identifies several differentially regulated genes between patients and controls in pancreatic endocrine cells. DAESC is a powerful method for single-cell ASE analysis and can uncover novel insights on gene regulation."
184,Spectroscape enables real-time query and visualization of a spectral archive in proteomics,"In proteomics, spectral archives organize the enormous amounts of publicly available peptide tandem mass spectra by similarity, offering opportunities for error correction and novel discoveries. Here we adapt an indexing algorithm developed by Facebook for organizing online multimedia resources to tandem mass spectra and achieve practically instantaneous retrieval and clustering of approximate nearest neighbors in a large spectral archive. An interactive web-based graphical user interface enables the user to view a query spectrum in its clustered neighborhood, which facilitates contextual validation of peptide identifications and exploration of the dark proteome."
185,MetaCC allows scalable and integrative analyses of both long-read and short-read metagenomic Hi-C data,"Metagenomic Hi-C (metaHi-C) can identify contig-to-contig relationships with respect to their proximity within the same physical cell. Shotgun libraries in metaHi-C experiments can be constructed by next-generation sequencing (short-read metaHi-C) or more recent third-generation sequencing (long-read metaHi-C). However, all existing metaHi-C analysis methods are developed and benchmarked on short-read metaHi-C datasets and there exists much room for improvement in terms of more scalable and stable analyses, especially for long-read metaHi-C data. Here we report MetaCC, an efficient and integrative framework for analyzing both short-read and long-read metaHi-C datasets. MetaCC outperforms existing methods on normalization and binning. In particular, the MetaCC normalization module, named NormCC, is more than 3000 times faster than the current state-of-the-art method HiCzin on a complex wastewater dataset. When applied to one sheep gut long-read metaHi-C dataset, MetaCC binning module can retrieve 709 high-quality genomes with the largest species diversity using one single sample, including an expansion of five uncultured members from the order 
Erysipelotrichales
, and is the only binner that can recover the genome of one important species 
Bacteroides vulgatus
. Further plasmid analyses reveal that MetaCC binning is able to capture multi-copy plasmids."
186,A unified method to revoke the private data of patients in intelligent healthcare with audit to forget,"Revoking personal private data is one of the basic human rights. However, such right is often overlooked or infringed upon due to the increasing collection and use of patient data for model training. In order to secure patients’ right to be forgotten, we proposed a solution by using auditing to guide the forgetting process, where auditing means determining whether a dataset has been used to train the model and forgetting requires the information of a query dataset to be forgotten from the target model. We unified these two tasks by introducing an approach called knowledge purification. To implement our solution, we developed an audit to forget software (AFS), which is able to evaluate and revoke patients’ private data from pre-trained deep learning models. Here, we show the usability of AFS and its application potential in real-world intelligent healthcare to enhance privacy protection and data revocation rights."
187,A pharmacophore-guided deep learning approach for bioactive molecular generation,"The rational design of novel molecules with the desired bioactivity is a critical but challenging task in drug discovery, especially when treating a novel target family or understudied targets. We propose a Pharmacophore-Guided deep learning approach for bioactive Molecule Generation (PGMG). Through the guidance of pharmacophore, PGMG provides a flexible strategy for generating bioactive molecules. PGMG uses a graph neural network to encode spatially distributed chemical features and a transformer decoder to generate molecules. A latent variable is introduced to solve the many-to-many mapping between pharmacophores and molecules to improve the diversity of the generated molecules. Compared to existing methods, PGMG generates molecules with strong docking affinities and high scores of validity, uniqueness, and novelty. In the case studies, we use PGMG in a ligand-based and structure-based drug de novo design. Overall, the flexibility and effectiveness make PGMG a useful tool to accelerate the drug discovery process."
188,Global burden of disease due to rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis: a mathematical modeling analysis,"In 2020, almost half a million individuals developed rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). We estimated the global burden of RR-TB over the lifetime of affected individuals. We synthesized data on incidence, case detection, and treatment outcomes in 192 countries (99.99% of global tuberculosis). Using a mathematical model, we projected disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over the lifetime for individuals developing tuberculosis in 2020 stratified by country, age, sex, HIV, and rifampicin resistance. Here we show that incident RR-TB in 2020 was responsible for an estimated 6.9 (95% uncertainty interval: 5.5, 8.5) million DALYs, 44% (31, 54) of which accrued among TB survivors. We estimated an average of 17 (14, 21) DALYs per person developing RR-TB, 34% (12, 56) greater than for rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis. RR-TB burden per 100,000 was highest in former Soviet Union countries and southern African countries. While RR-TB causes substantial short-term morbidity and mortality, nearly half of the overall disease burden of RR-TB accrues among tuberculosis survivors. The substantial long-term health impacts among those surviving RR-TB disease suggest the need for improved post-treatment care and further justify increased health expenditures to prevent RR-TB transmission."
189,Glycoproteomic landscape and structural dynamics of TIM family immune checkpoints enabled by mucinase SmE,"Mucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated and play critical roles in a host of biological functions. In particular, the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing family of proteins (TIM-1, -3, -4) decorate immune cells and act as key regulators in cellular immunity. However, their dense O-glycosylation remains enigmatic, primarily due to the challenges associated with studying mucin domains. Here, we demonstrate that the mucinase SmE has a unique ability to cleave at residues bearing very complex glycans. SmE enables improved mass spectrometric analysis of several mucins, including the entire TIM family. With this information in-hand, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TIM-3 and -4 to understand how glycosylation affects structural features of these proteins. Finally, we use these models to investigate the functional relevance of glycosylation for TIM-3 function and ligand binding. Overall, we present a powerful workflow to better understand the detailed molecular structures and functions of the mucinome."
190,CryoREAD: de novo structure modeling for nucleic acids in cryo-EM maps using deep learning,"DNA and RNA play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, where their three-dimensional structures provide information critical to understanding the molecular mechanisms of their functions. Although an increasing number of nucleic acid structures and their complexes with proteins are determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), structure modeling for DNA and RNA remains challenging particularly when the map is determined at a resolution coarser than atomic level. Moreover, computational methods for nucleic acid structure modeling are relatively scarce. Here, we present CryoREAD, a fully automated de novo DNA/RNA atomic structure modeling method using deep learning. CryoREAD identifies phosphate, sugar and base positions in a cryo-EM map using deep learning, which are traced and modeled into a three-dimensional structure. When tested on cryo-EM maps determined at 2.0 to 5.0 Å resolution, CryoREAD built substantially more accurate models than existing methods. We also applied the method to cryo-EM maps of biomolecular complexes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."
191,Benchmarking long-read RNA-sequencing analysis tools using in silico mixtures,"The lack of benchmark data sets with inbuilt ground-truth makes it challenging to compare the performance of existing long-read isoform detection and differential expression analysis workflows. Here, we present a benchmark experiment using two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that were each profiled in triplicate together with synthetic, spliced, spike-in RNAs (sequins). Samples were deeply sequenced on both Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read platforms. Alongside the ground-truth available via the sequins, we created in silico mixture samples to allow performance assessment in the absence of true positives or true negatives. Our results show that StringTie2 and bambu outperformed other tools from the six isoform detection tools tested, DESeq2, edgeR and limma-voom were best among the five differential transcript expression tools tested and there was no clear front-runner for performing differential transcript usage analysis between the five tools compared, which suggests further methods development is needed for this application."
192,Multifaceted analysis of cross-tissue transcriptomes reveals phenotype–endotype associations in atopic dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease that is heterogeneous both in terms of clinical manifestations and molecular profiles. It is increasingly recognized that AD is a systemic rather than a local disease and should be assessed in the context of whole-body pathophysiology. Here we show, via integrated RNA-sequencing of skin tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples along with clinical data from 115 AD patients and 14 matched healthy controls, that specific clinical presentations associate with matching differential molecular signatures. We establish a regression model based on transcriptome modules identified in weighted gene co-expression network analysis to extract molecular features associated with detailed clinical phenotypes of AD. The two main, qualitatively differential skin manifestations of AD, erythema and papulation are distinguished by differential immunological signatures. We further apply the regression model to a longitudinal dataset of 30 AD patients for personalized monitoring, highlighting patient heterogeneity in disease trajectories. The longitudinal features of blood tests and PBMC transcriptome modules identify three patient clusters which are aligned with clinical severity and reflect treatment history. Our approach thus serves as a framework for effective clinical investigation to gain a holistic view on the pathophysiology of complex human diseases."
193,Estimating the contribution of CD4 T cell subset proliferation and differentiation to HIV persistence,"Persistence of HIV in people living with HIV (PWH) on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been linked to physiological mechanisms of CD4+ T cells. Here, in the same 37 male PWH on ART we measure longitudinal kinetics of HIV DNA and cell turnover rates in five CD4 cell subsets: naïve (T
N
), stem-cell- (T
SCM
), central- (T
CM
), transitional- (T
TM
), and effector-memory (T
EM
). HIV decreases in T
TM
 and T
EM
 but not in less-differentiated subsets. Cell turnover is ~10 times faster than HIV clearance in memory subsets, implying that cellular proliferation consistently creates HIV DNA. The optimal mathematical model for these integrated data sets posits HIV DNA also passages between CD4 cell subsets via cellular differentiation. Estimates are heterogeneous, but in an average participant’s year ~10 (in T
N
 and T
SCM
) and ~10
4
 (in T
CM
, T
TM
, T
EM
) proviruses are generated by proliferation while ~10
3
 proviruses passage via cell differentiation (per million CD4). In simulations, therapies blocking proliferation and/or enhancing differentiation could reduce HIV DNA by 1-2 logs over 3 years. In summary, HIV exploits cellular proliferation and differentiation to persist during ART but clears faster in more proliferative/differentiated CD4 cell subsets and the same physiological mechanisms sustaining HIV might be temporarily modified to reduce it."
194,"“Redirecting an anti-IL-1β antibody to bind a new, unrelated and computationally predicted epitope on hIL-17A”","Antibody engineering technology is at the forefront of therapeutic antibody development. The primary goal for engineering a therapeutic antibody is the generation of an antibody with a desired specificity, affinity, function, and developability profile. Mature antibodies are considered antigen specific, which may preclude their use as a starting point for antibody engineering. Here, we explore the plasticity of mature antibodies by engineering novel specificity and function to a pre-selected antibody template. Using a small, focused library, we engineered AAL160, an anti-IL-1β antibody, to bind the unrelated antigen IL-17A, with the introduction of seven mutations. The final redesigned antibody, 11.003, retains favorable biophysical properties, binds IL-17A with sub-nanomolar affinity, inhibits IL-17A binding to its cognate receptor and is functional in a cell-based assay. The epitope of the engineered antibody can be computationally predicted based on the sequence of the template antibody, as is confirmed by the crystal structure of the 11.003/IL-17A complex. The structures of the 11.003/IL-17A and the AAL160/IL-1β complexes highlight the contribution of germline residues to the paratopes of both the template and re-designed antibody. This case study suggests that the inherent plasticity of antibodies allows for re-engineering of mature antibodies to new targets, while maintaining desirable developability profiles."
195,Learning single-cell perturbation responses using neural optimal transport,"Understanding and predicting molecular responses in single cells upon chemical, genetic or mechanical perturbations is a core question in biology. Obtaining single-cell measurements typically requires the cells to be destroyed. This makes learning heterogeneous perturbation responses challenging as we only observe unpaired distributions of perturbed or non-perturbed cells. Here we leverage the theory of optimal transport and the recent advent of input convex neural architectures to present CellOT, a framework for learning the response of individual cells to a given perturbation by mapping these unpaired distributions. CellOT outperforms current methods at predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein-imaging technology. Further, we illustrate that CellOT generalizes well on unseen settings by (1) predicting the scRNA-seq responses of holdout patients with lupus exposed to interferon-β and patients with glioblastoma to panobinostat; (2) inferring lipopolysaccharide responses across different species; and (3) modeling the hematopoietic developmental trajectories of different subpopulations."
196,A new Bayesian factor analysis method improves detection of genes and biological processes affected by perturbations in single-cell CRISPR screening,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize the effects of genetic perturbations on the whole transcriptome at a single-cell level. However, due to its sparsity and complex structure, analysis of single-cell CRISPR screening data is challenging. In particular, standard differential expression analysis methods are often underpowered to detect genes affected by CRISPR perturbations. We developed a statistical method for such data, called guided sparse factor analysis (GSFA). GSFA infers latent factors that represent coregulated genes or gene modules; by borrowing information from these factors, it infers the effects of genetic perturbations on individual genes. We demonstrated through extensive simulation studies that GSFA detects perturbation effects with much higher power than state-of-the-art methods. Using single-cell CRISPR data from human CD8
+
 T cells and neural progenitor cells, we showed that GSFA identified biologically relevant gene modules and specific genes affected by CRISPR perturbations, many of which were missed by existing methods, providing new insights into the functions of genes involved in T cell activation and neurodevelopment."
197,scBridge embraces cell heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data integration,"Single-cell multi-omics data integration aims to reduce the omics difference while keeping the cell type difference. However, it is daunting to model and distinguish the two differences due to cell heterogeneity. Namely, even cells of the same omics and type would have various features, making the two differences less significant. In this work, we reveal that instead of being an interference, cell heterogeneity could be exploited to improve data integration. Specifically, we observe that the omics difference varies in cells, and cells with smaller omics differences are easier to be integrated. Hence, unlike most existing works that homogeneously treat and integrate all cells, we propose a multi-omics data integration method (dubbed scBridge) that integrates cells in a heterogeneous manner. In brief, scBridge iterates between i) identifying reliable scATAC-seq cells that have smaller omics differences, and ii) integrating reliable scATAC-seq cells with scRNA-seq data to narrow the omics gap, thus benefiting the integration for the rest cells. Extensive experiments on seven multi-omics datasets demonstrate the superiority of scBridge compared with six representative baselines."
198,Defining the condensate landscape of fusion oncoproteins,"Fusion oncoproteins (FOs) arise from chromosomal translocations in ~17% of cancers and are often oncogenic drivers. Although some FOs can promote oncogenesis by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form aberrant biomolecular condensates, the generality of this phenomenon is unknown. We explored this question by testing 166 FOs in HeLa cells and found that 58% formed condensates. The condensate-forming FOs displayed physicochemical features distinct from those of condensate-negative FOs and segregated into distinct feature-based groups that aligned with their sub-cellular localization and biological function. Using Machine Learning, we developed a predictor of FO condensation behavior, and discovered that 67% of ~3000 additional FOs likely form condensates, with 35% of those predicted to function by altering gene expression. 47% of the predicted condensate-negative FOs were associated with cell signaling functions, suggesting a functional dichotomy between condensate-positive and -negative FOs. Our Datasets and reagents are rich resources to interrogate FO condensation in the future."
199,Computational remodeling of an enzyme conformational landscape for altered substrate selectivity,"Structural plasticity of enzymes dictates their function. Yet, our ability to rationally remodel enzyme conformational landscapes to tailor catalytic properties remains limited. Here, we report a computational procedure for tuning conformational landscapes that is based on multistate design of hinge-mediated domain motions. Using this method, we redesign the conformational landscape of a natural aminotransferase to preferentially stabilize a less populated but reactive conformation and thereby increase catalytic efficiency with a non-native substrate, resulting in altered substrate selectivity. Steady-state kinetics of designed variants reveals activity increases with the non-native substrate of approximately 100-fold and selectivity switches of up to 1900-fold. Structural analyses by room-temperature X-ray crystallography and multitemperature nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirm that conformational equilibria favor the target conformation. Our computational approach opens the door to targeted alterations of conformational states and equilibria, which should facilitate the design of biocatalysts with customized activity and selectivity."
200,PC3T: a signature-driven predictor of chemical compounds for cellular transition,"Cellular transitions hold great promise in translational medicine research. However, therapeutic applications are limited by the low efficiency and safety concerns of using transcription factors. Small molecules provide a temporal and highly tunable approach to overcome these issues. Here, we present PC3T, a computational framework to enrich molecules that induce desired cellular transitions, and PC3T was able to consistently enrich small molecules that had been experimentally validated in both bulk and single-cell datasets. We then predicted small molecule reprogramming of fibroblasts into hepatic progenitor-like cells (HPLCs). The converted cells exhibited epithelial cell-like morphology and HPLC-like gene expression pattern. Hepatic functions were also observed, such as glycogen storage and lipid accumulation. Finally, we collected and manually curated a cell state transition resource containing 224 time-course gene expression datasets and 153 cell types. Our framework, together with the data resource, is freely available at 
http://pc3t.idrug.net.cn/
. We believe that PC3T is a powerful tool to promote chemical-induced cell state transitions."
201,Methamphetamine-induced region-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in the brain of male rats,"Psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH) is neurotoxic to the brain and, therefore, its misuse leads to neurological and psychiatric disorders. The gene regulatory network (GRN) response to neurotoxic METH binge remains unclear in most brain regions. Here we examined the effects of binge METH on the GRN in the nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus, Ammon’s horn, and subventricular zone in male rats. At 24 h after METH, ~16% of genes displayed altered expression and over a quarter of previously open chromatin regions - parts of the genome where genes are typically active - showed shifts in their accessibility. Intriguingly, most changes were unique to each area studied, and independent regulation between transcriptome and chromatin accessibility was observed. Unexpectedly, METH differentially impacted gene activity and chromatin accessibility within the dentate gyrus and Ammon’s horn. Around 70% of the affected chromatin-accessible regions in the rat brain have conserved DNA sequences in the human genome. These regions frequently act as enhancers, ramping up the activity of nearby genes, and contain mutations linked to various neurological conditions. By sketching out the gene regulatory networks associated with binge METH in specific brain regions, our study offers fresh insights into how METH can trigger profound, region-specific molecular shifts."
202,Large-scale capture of hidden fluorescent labels for training generalizable markerless motion capture models,"Deep learning-based markerless tracking has revolutionized studies of animal behavior. Yet the generalizability of trained models tends to be limited, as new training data typically needs to be generated manually for each setup or visual environment. With each model trained from scratch, researchers track distinct landmarks and analyze the resulting kinematic data in idiosyncratic ways. Moreover, due to inherent limitations in manual annotation, only a sparse set of landmarks are typically labeled. To address these issues, we developed an approach, which we term GlowTrack, for generating orders of magnitude more training data, enabling models that generalize across experimental contexts. We describe: a) a high-throughput approach for producing hidden labels using fluorescent markers; b) a multi-camera, multi-light setup for simulating diverse visual conditions; and c) a technique for labeling many landmarks in parallel, enabling dense tracking. These advances lay a foundation for standardized behavioral pipelines and more complete scrutiny of movement."
203,Ictogenesis proceeds through discrete phases in hippocampal CA1 seizures in mice,"Epilepsy is characterized by spontaneous non-provoked seizures, yet the mechanisms that trigger a seizure and allow its evolution remain underexplored. To dissect out phases of ictogenesis, we evoked hypersynchronous activity with optogenetic stimulation. Focal optogenetic activation of putative excitatory neurons in the mouse hippocampal CA1 reliably evoked convulsive seizures in awake mice. A time-vs-time pulsogram plot characterized the evolution of the EEG pulse response from a light evoked response to induced seizure activity. Our results depict ictogenesis as a stepwise process comprised of three distinctive phases demarcated by two transition points. The induction phase undergoes the first transition to reverberant phase activity, followed by the second transition into the paroxysmal phase or a seizure. Non-seizure responses are confined to either induction or reverberant phases. The pulsogram was then constructed in seizures recorded from a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy and it depicted a similar reverberance preceding spontaneous seizures. The discovery of these distinct phases of ictogenesis may offer means to abort a seizure before it develops."
204,Patient-specific models link neurotransmitter receptor mechanisms with motor and visuospatial axes of Parkinson’s disease,"Parkinson’s disease involves multiple neurotransmitter systems beyond the classical dopaminergic circuit, but their influence on structural and functional alterations is not well understood. Here, we use patient-specific causal brain modeling to identify latent neurotransmitter receptor-mediated mechanisms contributing to Parkinson’s disease progression. Combining the spatial distribution of 15 receptors from post-mortem autoradiography with 6 neuroimaging-derived pathological factors, we detect a diverse set of receptors influencing gray matter atrophy, functional activity dysregulation, microstructural degeneration, and dendrite and dopaminergic transporter loss. Inter-individual variability in receptor mechanisms correlates with symptom severity along two distinct axes, representing motor and psychomotor symptoms with large GABAergic and glutamatergic contributions, and cholinergically-dominant visuospatial, psychiatric and memory dysfunction. Our work demonstrates that receptor architecture helps explain multi-factorial brain re-organization, and suggests that distinct, co-existing receptor-mediated processes underlie Parkinson’s disease."
205,A computational framework for the inference of protein complex remodeling from whole-proteome measurements,"Protein complexes are responsible for the enactment of most cellular functions. For the protein complex to form and function, its subunits often need to be present at defined quantitative ratios. Typically, global changes in protein complex composition are assessed with experimental approaches that tend to be time consuming. Here, we have developed a computational algorithm for the detection of altered protein complexes based on the systematic assessment of subunit ratios from quantitative proteomic measurements. We applied it to measurements from breast cancer cell lines and patient biopsies and were able to identify strong remodeling of HDAC2 epigenetic complexes in more aggressive forms of cancer. The presented algorithm is available as an R package and enables the inference of changes in protein complex states by extracting functionally relevant information from bottom-up proteomic datasets."
206,Genome-wide enhancer-gene regulatory maps link causal variants to target genes underlying human cancer risk,"Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous variants associated with human complex traits, most of which reside in the non-coding regions, but biological mechanisms remain unclear. However, assigning function to the non-coding elements is still challenging. Here we apply Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model to evaluate enhancer-gene regulation effect by integrating multi-omics data and identified 544,849 connections across 20 cancer types. ABC model outperforms previous approaches in linking regulatory variants to target genes. Furthermore, we identify over 30,000 enhancer-gene connections in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. By integrating large-scale population cohorts (23,813 cases and 29,973 controls) and multipronged functional assays, we demonstrate an ABC regulatory variant rs4810856 associated with CRC risk (Odds Ratio = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.05–1.16,

207,"Evolutionary signatures of human cancers revealed via genomic analysis of over 35,000 patients","Recurring sequences of genomic alterations occurring across patients can highlight repeated evolutionary processes with significant implications for predicting cancer progression. Leveraging the ever-increasing availability of cancer omics data, here we unveil cancer’s evolutionary signatures tied to distinct disease outcomes, representing “favored trajectories” of acquisition of driver mutations detected in patients with similar prognosis.

Validations on several datasets underscore the robustness and generalizability of the extracted signatures."
208,GiRAFR improves gRNA detection and annotation in single-cell CRISPR screens,"Novel methods that combine single cell RNA-seq with CRISPR screens enable high-throughput characterization of transcriptional changes caused by genetic perturbations. Dedicated software is however lacking to annotate CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) libraries and associate them with single cell transcriptomes. Here, we describe a CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) dataset. During analysis, we observed that the most commonly used method fails to detect mutant gRNAs. We therefore developed a python tool to identify and characterize intact and mutant gRNAs, called GiRAFR. We show that mutant gRNAs are dysfunctional, and failure to detect and annotate them leads to an inflated estimate of the number of untransformed cells, attenuated downregulation of target genes, as well as an underestimated multiplet frequency. These findings are mirrored in publicly available datasets, where we find that up to 35% of cells are transduced with a mutant gRNA. Applying GiRAFR hence stands to improve the annotation and quality of single cell CRISPR screens."
209,TAGET: a toolkit for analyzing full-length transcripts from long-read sequencing,"Single-molecule Real-time Isoform Sequencing (Iso-seq) of transcriptomes by PacBio can generate very long and accurate reads, thus providing an ideal platform for full-length transcriptome analysis. We present an integrated computational toolkit named TAGET for Iso-seq full-length transcript data analyses, including transcript alignment, annotation, gene fusion detection, and quantification analyses such as differential expression gene analysis and differential isoform usage analysis. We evaluate the performance of TAGET using a public Iso-seq dataset and newly sequenced Iso-seq datasets from tumor patients. TAGET gives significantly more precise novel splice site prediction and enables more accurate novel isoform and gene fusion discoveries, as validated by experimental validations and comparisons with RNA-seq data. We identify and experimentally validate a differential isoform usage gene 
ECM1
, and further show that its isoform ECM1b may be a tumor-suppressor in laryngocarcinoma. Our results demonstrate that TAGET provides a valuable computational toolkit and can be applied to many full-length transcriptome studies."
210,"Epitranscriptomic subtyping, visualization, and denoising by global motif visualization","Advances in sequencing technologies have empowered epitranscriptomic profiling at the single-base resolution. Putative RNA modification sites identified from a single high-throughput experiment may contain one type of modification deposited by different writers or different types of modifications, along with false positive results because of the challenge of distinguishing signals from noise. However, current tools are insufficient for subtyping, visualization, and denoising these signals. Here, we present iMVP, which is an interactive framework for epitranscriptomic analysis with a nonlinear dimension reduction technique and density-based partition. As exemplified by the analysis of mRNA m
5
C and ModTect variant data, we show that iMVP allows the identification of previously unknown RNA modification motifs and writers and the discovery of false positives that are undetectable by traditional methods. Using putative m

Am sites called from 8 profiling approaches, we illustrate that iMVP enables comprehensive comparison of different approaches and advances our understanding of the difference and pattern of true positives and artifacts in these methods. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of iMVP to analyze an extremely large human A-to-I editing dataset that was previously unmanageable. Our work provides a general framework for the visualization and interpretation of epitranscriptomic data."
211,Single-chain dimers from de novo immunoglobulins as robust scaffolds for multiple binding loops,"Antibody derivatives have sought to recapitulate the antigen binding properties of antibodies, but with improved biophysical attributes convenient for therapeutic, diagnostic and research applications. However, their success has been limited by the naturally occurring structure of the immunoglobulin dimer displaying hypervariable binding loops, which is hard to modify by traditional engineering approaches. Here, we devise geometrical principles for de novo designing single-chain immunoglobulin dimers, as a tunable two-domain architecture that optimizes biophysical properties through more favorable dimer interfaces. Guided by these principles, we computationally designed protein scaffolds that were hyperstable, structurally accurate and robust for accommodating multiple functional loops, both individually and in combination, as confirmed through biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. We showcase the modularity of this architecture by deep-learning-based diversification, opening up the possibility for tailoring the number, positioning, and relative orientation of ligand-binding loops targeting one or two distal epitopes. Our results provide a route to custom-design robust protein scaffolds for harboring multiple functional loops."
212,Improving genetic risk prediction across diverse population by disentangling ancestry representations,"Risk prediction models using genetic data have seen increasing traction in genomics. However, most of the polygenic risk models were developed using data from participants with similar (mostly European) ancestry. This can lead to biases in the risk predictors resulting in poor generalization when applied to minority populations and admixed individuals such as African Americans. To address this issue, largely due to the prediction models being biased by the underlying population structure, we propose a deep-learning framework that leverages data from diverse population and disentangles ancestry from the phenotype-relevant information in its representation. The ancestry disentangled representation can be used to build risk predictors that perform better across minority populations. We applied the proposed method to the analysis of Alzheimer’s disease genetics. Comparing with standard linear and nonlinear risk prediction methods, the proposed method substantially improves risk prediction in minority populations, including admixed individuals, without needing self-reported ancestry information."
213,"COSMOS: a platform for real-time morphology-based, label-free cell sorting using deep learning","Cells are the singular building blocks of life, and a comprehensive understanding of morphology, among other properties, is crucial to the assessment of underlying heterogeneity. We developed Computational Sorting and Mapping of Single Cells (COSMOS), a platform based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and microfluidics to characterize and sort single cells based on real-time deep learning interpretation of high-resolution brightfield images. Supervised deep learning models were applied to characterize and sort cell lines and dissociated primary tissue based on high-dimensional embedding vectors of morphology without the need for biomarker labels and stains/dyes. We demonstrate COSMOS capabilities with multiple human cell lines and tissue samples. These early results suggest that our neural networks embedding space can capture and recapitulate deep visual characteristics and can be used to efficiently purify unlabeled viable cells with desired morphological traits. Our approach resolves a technical gap in the ability to perform real-time deep learning assessment and sorting of cells based on high-resolution brightfield images."
214,Determining subunit-subunit interaction from statistics of cryo-EM images: observation of nearest-neighbor coupling in a circadian clock protein complex,"Biological processes are typically actuated by dynamic multi-subunit molecular complexes. However, interactions between subunits, which govern the functions of these complexes, are hard to measure directly. Here, we develop a general approach combining cryo-EM imaging technology and statistical modeling and apply it to study the hexameric clock protein KaiC in Cyanobacteria. By clustering millions of KaiC monomer images, we identify two major conformational states of KaiC monomers. We then classify the conformational states of (>160,000) KaiC hexamers by the thirteen distinct spatial arrangements of these two subunit states in the hexamer ring. We find that distributions of the thirteen hexamer conformational patterns for two KaiC phosphorylation mutants can be fitted quantitatively by an Ising model, which reveals a significant cooperativity between neighboring subunits with phosphorylation shifting the probability of subunit conformation. Our results show that a KaiC hexamer can respond in a switch-like manner to changes in its phosphorylation level."
215,"Seasonal pigment fluctuation in diploid and polyploid 
Arabidopsis
 revealed by machine learning-based phenotyping method PlantServation","Long-term field monitoring of leaf pigment content is informative for understanding plant responses to environments distinct from regulated chambers but is impractical by conventional destructive measurements. We developed PlantServation, a method incorporating robust image-acquisition hardware and deep learning-based software that extracts leaf color by detecting plant individuals automatically. As a case study, we applied PlantServation to examine environmental and genotypic effects on the pigment anthocyanin content estimated from leaf color. We processed >4 million images of small individuals of four 
Arabidopsis
 species in the field, where the plant shape, color, and background vary over months. Past radiation, coldness, and precipitation significantly affected the anthocyanin content. The synthetic allopolyploid 
A. kamchatica
 recapitulated the fluctuations of natural polyploids by integrating diploid responses. The data support a long-standing hypothesis stating that allopolyploids can inherit and combine the traits of progenitors. PlantServation facilitates the study of plant responses to complex environments termed “

216,EzMechanism: an automated tool to propose catalytic mechanisms of enzyme reactions,"Over the years, hundreds of enzyme reaction mechanisms have been studied using experimental and simulation methods. This rich literature on biological catalysis is now ripe for use as the foundation of new knowledge-based approaches to investigate enzyme mechanisms. Here, we present a tool able to automatically infer mechanistic paths for a given three-dimensional active site and enzyme reaction, based on a set of catalytic rules compiled from the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas, a database of enzyme mechanisms. EzMechanism (pronounced as ‘Easy’ Mechanism) is available to everyone through a web user interface. When studying a mechanism, EzMechanism facilitates and improves the generation of hypotheses, by making sure that relevant information is considered, as derived from the literature on both related and unrelated enzymes. We validated EzMechanism on a set of 62 enzymes and have identified paths for further improvement, including the need for additional and more generic catalytic rules."
217,Deep generative modeling of transcriptional dynamics for RNA velocity analysis in single cells,"RNA velocity has been rapidly adopted to guide interpretation of transcriptional dynamics in snapshot single-cell data; however, current approaches for estimating RNA velocity lack effective strategies for quantifying uncertainty and determining the overall applicability to the system of interest. Here, we present veloVI (velocity variational inference), a deep generative modeling framework for estimating RNA velocity. veloVI learns a gene-specific dynamical model of RNA metabolism and provides a transcriptome-wide quantification of velocity uncertainty. We show that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches with respect to goodness of fit, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that veloVI’s posterior velocity uncertainty can be used to assess whether velocity analysis is appropriate for a given dataset. Finally, we highlight veloVI as a flexible framework for modeling transcriptional dynamics by adapting the underlying dynamical model to use time-dependent transcription rates."
218,DeepSlice: rapid fully automatic registration of mouse brain imaging to a volumetric atlas,"Registration of data to a common frame of reference is an essential step in the analysis and integration of diverse neuroscientific data. To this end, volumetric brain atlases enable histological datasets to be spatially registered and analyzed, yet accurate registration remains expertise-dependent and slow. In order to address this limitation, we have trained a neural network, DeepSlice, to register mouse brain histological images to the Allen Brain Common Coordinate Framework, retaining registration accuracy while improving speed by >1000 fold."
219,Fast and robust metagenomic sequence comparison through sparse chaining with skani,"Sequence comparison tools for metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) struggle with high-volume or low-quality data. We present skani (
https://github.com/bluenote-1577/skani
), a method for determining average nucleotide identity (ANI) via sparse approximate alignments. skani outperforms FastANI in accuracy and speed (>20× faster) for fragmented, incomplete MAGs. skani can query genomes against >65,000 prokaryotic genomes in seconds and 6 GB memory. skani unlocks higher-resolution insights for extensive, noisy metagenomic datasets."
220,Flash entropy search to query all mass spectral libraries in real time,"Public repositories of metabolomics mass spectra encompass more than 1 billion entries. With open search, dot product or entropy similarity, comparisons of a single tandem mass spectrometry spectrum take more than 8 h. Flash entropy search speeds up calculations more than 10,000 times to query 1 billion spectra in less than 2 s, without loss in accuracy. It benefits from using multiple threads and GPU calculations. This algorithm can fully exploit large spectral libraries with little memory overhead for any mass spectrometry laboratory."
221,Thermodynamic forces from protein and water govern condensate formation of an intrinsically disordered protein domain,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) can drive a multitude of cellular processes by compartmentalizing biological cells via the formation of dense liquid biomolecular condensates, which can function as membraneless organelles. Despite its importance, the molecular-level understanding of the underlying thermodynamics of this process remains incomplete. In this study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the low complexity domain (LCD) of human fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein to investigate the contributions of water and protein molecules to the free energy changes that govern LLPS. Both protein and water components are found to have comparably sizeable thermodynamic contributions to the formation of FUS condensates. Moreover, we quantify the counteracting effects of water molecules that are released into the bulk upon condensate formation and the waters retained within the protein droplets. Among the various factors considered, solvation entropy and protein interaction enthalpy are identified as the most important contributions, while solvation enthalpy and protein entropy changes are smaller. These results provide detailed molecular insights on the intricate thermodynamic interplay between protein- and solvation-related forces underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates."
222,epiAneufinder identifies copy number alterations from single-cell ATAC-seq data,"Single-cell open chromatin profiling via scATAC-seq has become a mainstream measurement of open chromatin in single-cells. Here we present epiAneufinder, an algorithm that exploits the read count information from scATAC-seq data to extract genome-wide copy number alterations (CNAs) for individual cells, allowing the study of CNA heterogeneity present in a sample at the single-cell level. Using different cancer scATAC-seq datasets, we show that epiAneufinder can identify intratumor clonal heterogeneity in populations of single cells based on their CNA profiles. We demonstrate that these profiles are concordant with the ones inferred from single-cell whole genome sequencing data for the same samples. EpiAneufinder allows the inference of single-cell CNA information from scATAC-seq data, without the need of additional experiments, unlocking a layer of genomic variation which is otherwise unexplored."
223,SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize 23 distinct epitopic sites on the receptor binding domain,"The COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 variants have dramatically illustrated the need for a better understanding of antigen (epitope)-antibody (paratope) interactions. To gain insight into the immunogenic characteristics of epitopic sites (ES), we systematically investigated the structures of 340 Abs and 83 nanobodies (Nbs) complexed with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We identified 23 distinct ES on the RBD surface and determined the frequencies of amino acid usage in the corresponding CDR paratopes. We describe a clustering method for analysis of ES similarities that reveals binding motifs of the paratopes and that provides insights for vaccine design and therapies for SARS-CoV-2, as well as a broader understanding of the structural basis of Ab-protein antigen (Ag) interactions."
224,SEPepQuant enhances the detection of possible isoform regulations in shotgun proteomics,"Shotgun proteomics is essential for protein identification and quantification in biomedical research, but protein isoform characterization is challenging due to the extensive number of peptides shared across proteins, hindering our understanding of protein isoform regulation and their roles in normal and disease biology. We systematically assess the challenge and opportunities of shotgun proteomics-based protein isoform characterization using in silico and experimental data, and then present SEPepQuant, a graph theory-based approach to maximize isoform characterization. Using published data from one induced pluripotent stem cell study and two human hepatocellular carcinoma studies, we demonstrate the ability of SEPepQuant in addressing the key limitations of existing methods, providing more comprehensive isoform-level characterization, identifying hundreds of isoform-level regulation events, and facilitating streamlined cross-study comparisons. Our analysis provides solid evidence to support a widespread role of protein isoform regulation in normal and disease processes, and SEPepQuant has broad applications to biological and translational research."
225,Context-dependent perturbations in chromatin folding and the transcriptome by cohesin and related factors,"Cohesin regulates gene expression through context-specific chromatin folding mechanisms such as enhancer–promoter looping and topologically associating domain (TAD) formation by cooperating with factors such as cohesin loaders and the insulation factor CTCF. We developed a computational workflow to explore how three-dimensional (3D) structure and gene expression are regulated collectively or individually by cohesin and related factors. The main component is CustardPy, by which multi-omics datasets are compared systematically. To validate our methodology, we generated 3D genome, transcriptome, and epigenome data before and after depletion of cohesin and related factors and compared the effects of depletion. We observed diverse effects on the 3D genome and transcriptome, and gene expression changes were correlated with the splitting of TADs caused by cohesin loss. We also observed variations in long-range interactions across TADs, which correlated with their epigenomic states. These computational tools and datasets will be valuable for 3D genome and epigenome studies."
226,A robust normalized local filter to estimate compositional heterogeneity directly from cryo-EM maps,"Cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is used by biological research to visualize biomolecular complexes in 3D, but the heterogeneity of cryo-EM reconstructions is not easily estimated. Current processing paradigms nevertheless exert great effort to reduce flexibility and heterogeneity to improve the quality of the reconstruction. Clustering algorithms are typically employed to identify populations of data with reduced variability, but lack assessment of remaining heterogeneity. Here we develope a fast and simple algorithm based on spatial filtering to estimate the heterogeneity of a reconstruction. In the absence of flexibility, this estimate approximates macromolecular component occupancy. We show that our implementation can derive reasonable input parameters, that composition heterogeneity can be estimated based on contrast loss, and that the reconstruction can be modified accordingly to emulate altered constituent occupancy. This stands to benefit conventionally employed maximum-likelihood classification methods, whereas we here limit considerations to cryo-EM map interpretation, quantification, and particle-image signal subtraction."
227,The tumor microenvironment shows a hierarchy of cell-cell interactions dominated by fibroblasts,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of non-malignant cells that interact with each other and with cancer cells, critically impacting cancer biology. The TME is complex, and understanding it requires simplifying approaches. Here we provide an experimental-mathematical approach to decompose the TME into small circuits of interacting cell types. We find, using female breast cancer single-cell-RNA-sequencing data, a hierarchical network of interactions, with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) at the top secreting factors primarily to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This network is composed of repeating circuit motifs. We isolate the strongest two-cell circuit motif by culturing fibroblasts and macrophages in-vitro, and analyze their dynamics and transcriptomes. This isolated circuit recapitulates the hierarchy of in-vivo interactions, and enables testing the effect of ligand-receptor interactions on cell dynamics and function, as we demonstrate by identifying a mediator of CAF-TAM interactions - RARRES2, and its receptor CMKLR1. Thus, the complexity of the TME may be simplified by identifying small circuits, facilitating the development of strategies to modulate the TME."
228,Translating genomic tools to Raman spectroscopy analysis enables high-dimensional tissue characterization on molecular resolution,"Spatial transcriptomics of histological sections have revolutionized research in life sciences and enabled unprecedented insights into genetic processes involved in tissue reorganization. However, in contrast to genomic analysis, the actual biomolecular composition of the sample has fallen behind, leaving a gap of potentially highly valuable information. Raman microspectroscopy provides untargeted spatiomolecular information at high resolution, capable of filling this gap. In this study we demonstrate spatially resolved Raman “spectromics” to reveal homogeneity, heterogeneity and dynamics of cell matrix on molecular levels by repurposing state-of-the-art bioinformatic analysis tools commonly used for transcriptomic analyses. By exploring sections of murine myocardial infarction and cardiac hypertrophy, we identify myocardial subclusters when spatially approaching the pathology, and define the surrounding metabolic and cellular (immune-) landscape. Our innovative, label-free, non-invasive “spectromics” approach could therefore open perspectives for a profound characterization of histological samples, while additionally allowing the combination with consecutive downstream analyses of the very same specimen."
229,Statistically unbiased prediction enables accurate denoising of voltage imaging data,"Here we report SUPPORT (statistically unbiased prediction utilizing spatiotemporal information in imaging data), a self-supervised learning method for removing Poisson–Gaussian noise in voltage imaging data. SUPPORT is based on the insight that a pixel value in voltage imaging data is highly dependent on its spatiotemporal neighboring pixels, even when its temporally adjacent frames alone do not provide useful information for statistical prediction. Such dependency is captured and used by a convolutional neural network with a spatiotemporal blind spot to accurately denoise voltage imaging data in which the existence of the action potential in a time frame cannot be inferred by the information in other frames. Through simulations and experiments, we show that SUPPORT enables precise denoising of voltage imaging data and other types of microscopy image while preserving the underlying dynamics within the scene."

N
-glycosyltransferases (NGTs) catalyze the glycosylation of Asn residues in proteins, a process fundamental for bacterial autoaggregation, adhesion and pathogenicity.

231,Natural plant growth and development achieved in the IPK PhenoSphere by dynamic environment simulation,"In plant science, the suboptimal match of growing conditions hampers the transfer of knowledge from controlled environments in glasshouses or climate chambers to field environments. Here we present the PhenoSphere, a plant cultivation infrastructure designed to simulate field-like environments in a reproducible manner. To benchmark the PhenoSphere, the effects on plant growth of weather conditions of a single maize growing season and of an averaged season over three years are compared to those of a standard glasshouse and of four years of field trials. The single season simulation proves superior to the glasshouse and the averaged season in the PhenoSphere: The simulated weather regime of the single season triggers plant growth and development progression very similar to that observed in the field. Hence, the PhenoSphere enables detailed analyses of performance-related trait expression and causal biological mechanisms in plant populations exposed to weather conditions of current and anticipated future climate scenarios."
232,Circular RNAs in the human brain are tailored to neuron identity and neuropsychiatric disease,"Little is known about circular RNAs (circRNAs) in specific brain cells and human neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we systematically identify over 11,039 circRNAs expressed in vulnerable dopamine and pyramidal neurons laser-captured from 190 human brains and non-neuronal cells using ultra-deep, total RNA sequencing. 1526 and 3308 circRNAs are custom-tailored to the cell identity of dopamine and pyramidal neurons and enriched in synapse pathways. 29% of Parkinson’s and 12% of Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes produced validated circRNAs. 
circDNAJC6
, which is transcribed from a juvenile-onset Parkinson’s gene, is already dysregulated during prodromal, onset stages of common Parkinson’s disease neuropathology. Globally, addiction-associated genes preferentially produce circRNAs in dopamine neurons, autism-associated genes in pyramidal neurons, and cancers in non-neuronal cells. This study shows that circular RNAs in the human brain are tailored to neuron identity and implicate circRNA-regulated synaptic specialization in neuropsychiatric diseases."
233,Integrating end-to-end learning with deep geometrical potentials for ab initio RNA structure prediction,"RNAs are fundamental in living cells and perform critical functions determined by their tertiary architectures. However, accurate modeling of 3D RNA structure remains a challenging problem. We present a novel method, DRfold, to predict RNA tertiary structures by simultaneous learning of local frame rotations and geometric restraints from experimentally solved RNA structures, where the learned knowledge is converted into a hybrid energy potential to guide RNA structure assembly. The method significantly outperforms previous approaches by >73.3% in TM-score on a sequence-nonredundant dataset containing recently released structures. Detailed analyses showed that the major contribution to the improvements arise from the deep end-to-end learning supervised with the atom coordinates and the composite energy function integrating complementary information from geometry restraints and end-to-end learning models. The open-source DRfold program with fast training protocol allows large-scale application of high-resolution RNA structure modeling and can be further improved with future expansion of RNA structure databases."
234,Performance of tumour microenvironment deconvolution methods in breast cancer using single-cell simulated bulk mixtures,"Cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME) can impact tumour development and influence treatment response. Computational approaches have been developed to deconvolve the TME from bulk RNA-seq. Using scRNA-seq profiling from breast tumours we simulate thousands of bulk mixtures, representing tumour purities and cell lineages, to compare the performance of nine TME deconvolution methods (BayesPrism, Scaden, CIBERSORTx, MuSiC, DWLS, hspe, CPM, Bisque, and EPIC). 
S
ome methods are more robust in deconvolving mixtures with high tumour purity levels. Most methods tend to mis-predict normal epithelial for cancer epithelial as tumour purity increases, a finding that is validated in two independent datasets. The breast cancer molecular subtype influences this mis-prediction. BayesPrism and DWLS have the lowest combined numbers of false positives and false negatives, and have the best performance when deconvolving granular immune lineages. Our findings highlight the need for more single-cell characterisation of rarer cell types, and suggest that tumour cell compositions should be considered when deconvolving the TME."
235,Machine learning coarse-grained potentials of protein thermodynamics,"A generalized understanding of protein dynamics is an unsolved scientific problem, the solution of which is critical to the interpretation of the structure-function relationships that govern essential biological processes. Here, we approach this problem by constructing coarse-grained molecular potentials based on artificial neural networks and grounded in statistical mechanics. For training, we build a unique dataset of unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 9 ms for twelve different proteins with multiple secondary structure arrangements. The coarse-grained models are capable of accelerating the dynamics by more than three orders of magnitude while preserving the thermodynamics of the systems. Coarse-grained simulations identify relevant structural states in the ensemble with comparable energetics to the all-atom systems. Furthermore, we show that a single coarse-grained potential can integrate all twelve proteins and can capture experimental structural features of mutated proteins. These results indicate that machine learning coarse-grained potentials could provide a feasible approach to simulate and understand protein dynamics."
236,Divergent single cell transcriptome and epigenome alterations in ALS and FTD patients with C9orf72 mutation,"A repeat expansion in the C9orf72 (C9) gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here we investigate single nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) and epigenomics (snATAC-seq) in postmortem motor and frontal cortices from C9-ALS, C9-FTD, and control donors. C9-ALS donors present pervasive alterations of gene expression with concordant changes in chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. The greatest alterations occur in upper and deep layer excitatory neurons, as well as in astrocytes. In neurons, the changes imply an increase in proteostasis, metabolism, and protein expression pathways, alongside a decrease in neuronal function. In astrocytes, the alterations suggest activation and structural remodeling. Conversely, C9-FTD donors have fewer high-quality neuronal nuclei in the frontal cortex and numerous gene expression changes in glial cells. These findings highlight a context-dependent molecular disruption in C9-ALS and C9-FTD, indicating unique effects across cell types, brain regions, and diseases."
237,First fully-automated AI/ML virtual screening cascade implemented at a drug discovery centre in Africa,"Streamlined data-driven drug discovery remains challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. We present ZairaChem, an artificial intelligence (AI)- and machine learning (ML)-based tool for quantitative structure-activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) modelling. ZairaChem is fully automated, requires low computational resources and works across a broad spectrum of datasets. We describe an end-to-end implementation at the H3D Centre, the leading integrated drug discovery unit in Africa, at which no prior AI/ML capabilities were available. By leveraging in-house data collected over a decade, we have developed a virtual screening cascade for malaria and tuberculosis drug discovery comprising 15 models for key decision-making assays ranging from whole-cell phenotypic screening and cytotoxicity to aqueous solubility, permeability, microsomal metabolic stability, cytochrome inhibition, and cardiotoxicity. We show how computational profiling of compounds, prior to synthesis and testing, can inform progression of frontrunner compounds at H3D. This project is a first-of-its-kind deployment at scale of AI/ML tools in a research centre operating in a low-resource setting."
238,Local flux coordination and global gene expression regulation in metabolic modeling,"Genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMs) are fundamental systems biology representations of a cell’s entire set of stoichiometrically balanced reactions. However, such static GSMs do not incorporate the functional organization of metabolic genes and their dynamic regulation (e.g., operons and regulons). Specifically, there are numerous topologically coupled local reactions through which fluxes are coordinated; the global growth state often dynamically regulates many gene expression of metabolic reactions via global transcription factor regulators. Here, we develop a GSM reconstruction method, Decrem, by integrating locally coupled reactions and global transcriptional regulation of metabolism by cell state. Decrem produces predictions of flux and growth rates, which are highly correlated with those experimentally measured in both wild-type and mutants of three model microorganisms 
Escherichia coli
, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
, and 
Bacillus subtilis
 under various conditions. More importantly, Decrem can also explain the observed growth rates by capturing the experimentally measured flux changes between wild-types and mutants. Overall, by identifying and incorporating locally organized and regulated functional modules into GSMs, Decrem achieves accurate predictions of phenotypes and has broad applications in bioengineering, synthetic biology, and microbial pathology."
239,A landscape of complex tandem repeats within individual human genomes,"Markedly expanded tandem repeats (TRs) have been correlated with ~60 diseases. TR diversity has been considered a clue toward understanding missing heritability. However, haplotype-resolved long TRs remain mostly hidden or blacked out because their complex structures (TRs composed of various units and minisatellites containing >10-bp units) make them difficult to determine accurately with existing methods. Here, using a high-precision algorithm to determine complex TR structures from long, accurate reads of PacBio HiFi, an investigation of 270 Japanese control samples yields several genome-wide findings. Approximately 322,000 TRs are difficult to impute from the surrounding single-nucleotide variants. Greater genetic divergence of TR loci is significantly correlated with more events of younger replication slippage. Complex TRs are more abundant than single-unit TRs, and a tendency for complex TRs to consist of <10-bp units and single-unit TRs to be minisatellites is statistically significant at loci with ≥500-bp TRs. Of note, 8909 loci with extended TRs (>100b longer than the mode) contain several known disease-associated TRs and are considered candidates for association with disorders. Overall, complex TRs and minisatellites are found to be abundant and diverse, even in genetically small Japanese populations, yielding insights into the landscape of long TRs."
240,DNA methylation profiling to determine the primary sites of metastatic cancers using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues,"Identifying the primary site of metastatic cancer is critical to guiding the subsequent treatment. Approximately 3–9% of metastatic patients are diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary sites (CUP) even after a comprehensive diagnostic workup. However, a widely accepted molecular test is still not available. Here, we report a method that applies formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues to construct reduced representation bisulfite sequencing libraries (FFPE-RRBS). We then generate and systematically evaluate 28 molecular classifiers, built on four DNA methylation scoring methods and seven machine learning approaches, using the RRBS library dataset of 498 fresh-frozen tumor tissues from primary cancer patients. Among these classifiers, the 
be
ta value-based 
li
near support 
ve
ctor (BELIVE) performs the best, achieving overall accuracies of 81-93% for identifying the primary sites in 215 metastatic patients using top-k predictions (k = 1, 2, 3). Coincidentally, BELIVE also successfully predicts the tissue of origin in 81-93% of CUP patients (n = 68)."
241,Time space and single-cell resolved tissue lineage trajectories and laterality of body plan at gastrulation,"Understanding of the molecular drivers of lineage diversification and tissue patterning during primary germ layer development requires in-depth knowledge of the dynamic molecular trajectories of cell lineages across a series of developmental stages of gastrulation. Through computational modeling, we constructed at single-cell resolution, a spatio-temporal transcriptome of cell populations in the germ-layers of gastrula-stage mouse embryos. This molecular atlas enables the inference of molecular network activity underpinning the specification and differentiation of the germ-layer tissue lineages. Heterogeneity analysis of cellular composition at defined positions in the epiblast revealed progressive diversification of cell types. The single-cell transcriptome revealed an enhanced BMP signaling activity in the right-side mesoderm of late-gastrulation embryo. Perturbation of asymmetric BMP signaling activity at late gastrulation led to randomization of left-right molecular asymmetry in the lateral mesoderm of early-somite-stage embryo. These findings indicate the asymmetric BMP activity during gastrulation may be critical for the symmetry breaking process."
242,Global impact of somatic structural variation on the cancer proteome,"Both proteome and transcriptome data can help assess the relevance of non-coding somatic mutations in cancer. Here, we combine mass spectrometry-based proteomics data with whole genome sequencing data across 1307 human tumors spanning various tissues to determine the extent somatic structural variant (SV) breakpoint patterns impact protein expression of nearby genes. We find that about 25% of the hundreds of genes with SV-associated cis-regulatory alterations at the mRNA level are similarly associated at the protein level. SVs associated with enhancer hijacking, retrotransposon translocation, altered DNA methylation, or fusion transcripts are implicated in protein over-expression. SVs combined with altered protein levels considerably extend the numbers of patients with tumors somatically altered for critical pathways. We catalog both SV breakpoint patterns involving patient survival and genes with nearby SV breakpoints associated with increased cell dependency in cancer cell lines. Pan-cancer proteogenomics identifies targetable non-coding alterations, by virtue of the associated deregulated genes."
243,De novo design of highly selective miniprotein inhibitors of integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8,"The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between homologous αvβ6 and αvβ8 and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have high thermal stability could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecule and antibody inhibitors do not have all these properties, and hence new approaches are needed. Here we describe a generalized method for computationally designing RGD-containing miniproteins selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state. We design hyperstable, selective αvβ6 and αvβ8 inhibitors that bind with picomolar affinity. CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very close to the computational design models, and show that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the αvβ6 and the αvβ8 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the αvβ6 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity."
244,SiGra: single-cell spatial elucidation through an image-augmented graph transformer,"Recent advances in high-throughput molecular imaging have pushed spatial transcriptomics technologies to subcellular resolution, which surpasses the limitations of both single-cell RNA-seq and array-based spatial profiling. The multichannel immunohistochemistry images in such data provide rich information on the cell types, functions, and morphologies of cellular compartments. In this work, we developed a method, single-cell spatial elucidation through image-augmented Graph transformer (SiGra), to leverage such imaging information for revealing spatial domains and enhancing substantially sparse and noisy transcriptomics data. SiGra applies hybrid graph transformers over a single-cell spatial graph. SiGra outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both single-cell and spot-level spatial transcriptomics data from complex tissues. The inclusion of immunohistochemistry images improves the model performance by 37% (95% CI: 27–50%). SiGra improves the characterization of intratumor heterogeneity and intercellular communication and recovers the known microscopic anatomy. Overall, SiGra effectively integrates different spatial modality data to gain deep insights into spatial cellular ecosystems."
245,A self-supervised deep learning method for data-efficient training in genomics,"Deep learning in bioinformatics is often limited to problems where extensive amounts of labeled data are available for supervised classification. By exploiting unlabeled data, self-supervised learning techniques can improve the performance of machine learning models in the presence of limited labeled data. Although many self-supervised learning methods have been suggested before, they have failed to exploit the unique characteristics of genomic data. Therefore, we introduce 
Self-GenomeNet
, a self-supervised learning technique that is custom-tailored for genomic data. 
Self-GenomeNet
 leverages reverse-complement sequences and effectively learns short- and long-term dependencies by predicting targets of different lengths. 
Self-GenomeNet
 performs better than other self-supervised methods in data-scarce genomic tasks and outperforms standard supervised training with ~10 times fewer labeled training data. Furthermore, the learned representations generalize well to new datasets and tasks. These findings suggest that 
Self-GenomeNet
 is well suited for large-scale, unlabeled genomic datasets and could substantially improve the performance of genomic models."
246,Recovery of missing single-cell RNA-sequencing data with optimized transcriptomic references,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an indispensable tool for characterizing cellular diversity and generating hypotheses throughout biology. Droplet-based scRNA-seq datasets often lack expression data for genes that can be detected with other methods. Here we show that the observed sensitivity deficits stem from three sources: (1) poor annotation of 3′ gene ends; (2) issues with intronic read incorporation; and (3) gene overlap-derived read loss. We show that missing gene expression data can be recovered by optimizing the reference transcriptome for scRNA-seq through recovering false intergenic reads, implementing a hybrid pre-mRNA mapping strategy and resolving gene overlaps. We demonstrate, with a diverse collection of mouse and human tissue data, that reference optimization can substantially improve cellular profiling resolution and reveal missing cell types and marker genes. Our findings argue that transcriptomic references need to be optimized for scRNA-seq analysis and warrant a reanalysis of previously published datasets and cell atlases."
247,Transfer Learning with Kernel Methods,"Transfer learning refers to the process of adapting a model trained on a source task to a target task. While kernel methods are conceptually and computationally simple models that are competitive on a variety of tasks, it has been unclear how to develop scalable kernel-based transfer learning methods across general source and target tasks with possibly differing label dimensions. In this work, we propose a transfer learning framework for kernel methods by projecting and translating the source model to the target task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in applications to image classification and virtual drug screening. For both applications, we identify simple scaling laws that characterize the performance of transfer-learned kernels as a function of the number of target examples. We explain this phenomenon in a simplified linear setting, where we are able to derive the exact scaling laws."
248,Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,"Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies."
249,Deciphering complex breakage-fusion-bridge genome rearrangements with Ambigram,"Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) is a complex rearrangement that leads to tumor malignancy. Existing models for detecting BFBs rely on the ideal BFB hypothesis, ruling out the possibility of BFBs entangled with other structural variations, that is, 
complex BFBs
. We propose an algorithm Ambigram to identify complex BFB and reconstruct the rearranged structure of the local genome during the cancer subclone evolution process. Ambigram handles data from short, linked, long, and single-cell sequences, and optical mapping technologies. Ambigram successfully deciphers the gold- or silver-standard complex BFBs against the state-of-the-art in multiple cancers. Ambigram dissects the intratumor heterogeneity of complex BFB events with single-cell reads from melanoma and gastric cancer. Furthermore, applying Ambigram to liver and cervical cancer data suggests that the BFB mechanism may mediate oncovirus integrations. BFB also exists in noncancer genomics. Investigating the complete human genome reference with Ambigram suggests that the BFB mechanism may be involved in two genome reorganizations of 
Homo Sapiens
 during evolution. Moreover, Ambigram discovers the signals of recurrent foldback inversions and complex BFBs in whole genome data from the 1000 genome project, and congenital heart diseases, respectively."
250,FIOLA: an accelerated pipeline for fluorescence imaging online analysis,"Optical microscopy methods such as calcium and voltage imaging enable fast activity readout of large neuronal populations using light. However, the lack of corresponding advances in online algorithms has slowed progress in retrieving information about neural activity during or shortly after an experiment. This gap not only prevents the execution of real-time closed-loop experiments, but also hampers fast experiment–analysis–theory turnover for high-throughput imaging modalities. Reliable extraction of neural activity from fluorescence imaging frames at speeds compatible with indicator dynamics and imaging modalities poses a challenge. We therefore developed FIOLA, a framework for fluorescence imaging online analysis that extracts neuronal activity from calcium and voltage imaging movies at speeds one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods. FIOLA exploits algorithms optimized for parallel processing on GPUs and CPUs. We demonstrate reliable and scalable performance of FIOLA on both simulated and real calcium and voltage imaging datasets. Finally, we present an online experimental scenario to provide guidance in setting FIOLA parameters and to highlight the trade-offs of our approach."
251,Mining multi-center heterogeneous medical data with distributed synthetic learning,"Overcoming barriers on the use of multi-center data for medical analytics is challenging due to privacy protection and data heterogeneity in the healthcare system. In this study, we propose the Distributed Synthetic Learning (DSL) architecture to learn across multiple medical centers and ensure the protection of sensitive personal information. DSL enables the building of a homogeneous dataset with entirely synthetic medical images via a form of GAN-based synthetic learning. The proposed DSL architecture has the following key functionalities: multi-modality learning, missing modality completion learning, and continual learning. We systematically evaluate the performance of DSL on different medical applications using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA), brain tumor MRI, and histopathology nuclei datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSL as a high-quality synthetic medical image provider by the use of an ideal synthetic quality metric called Dist-FID. We show that DSL can be adapted to heterogeneous data and remarkably outperforms the real misaligned modalities segmentation model by 55% and the temporal datasets segmentation model by 8%."
252,A generalizable Cas9/sgRNA prediction model using machine transfer learning with small high-quality datasets,"The CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease from 
Streptococcus pyogenes
 (SpCas9) can be used with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) as a sequence-specific antimicrobial agent and as a genome-engineering tool. However, current bacterial sgRNA activity models struggle with accurate predictions and do not generalize well, possibly because the underlying datasets used to train the models do not accurately measure SpCas9/sgRNA activity and cannot distinguish on-target cleavage from toxicity. Here, we solve this problem by using a two-plasmid positive selection system to generate high-quality data that more accurately reports on SpCas9/sgRNA cleavage and that separates activity from toxicity. We develop a machine learning architecture (crisprHAL) that can be trained on existing datasets, that shows marked improvements in sgRNA activity prediction accuracy when transfer learning is used with small amounts of high-quality data, and that can generalize predictions to different bacteria. The crisprHAL model recapitulates known SpCas9/sgRNA-target DNA interactions and provides a pathway to a generalizable sgRNA bacterial activity prediction tool that will enable accurate antimicrobial and genome engineering applications."
253,Demonstration of an AI-driven workflow for autonomous high-resolution scanning microscopy,"Modern scanning microscopes can image materials with up to sub-atomic spatial and sub-picosecond time resolutions, but these capabilities come with large volumes of data, which can be difficult to store and analyze. We report the Fast Autonomous Scanning Toolkit (FAST) that addresses this challenge by combining a neural network, route optimization, and efficient hardware controls to enable a self-driving experiment that actively identifies and measures a sparse but representative data subset in lieu of the full dataset. FAST requires no prior information about the sample, is computationally efficient, and uses generic hardware controls with minimal experiment-specific wrapping. We test FAST in simulations and a dark-field X-ray microscopy experiment of a WSe
2
 film. Our studies show that a FAST scan of <25% is sufficient to accurately image and analyze the sample. FAST is easy to adapt for any scanning microscope; its broad adoption will empower general multi-level studies of materials evolution with respect to time, temperature, or other parameters."
254,RNA contact prediction by data efficient deep learning,"On the path to full understanding of the structure-function relationship or even design of RNA, structure prediction would offer an intriguing complement to experimental efforts. Any deep learning on RNA structure, however, is hampered by the sparsity of labeled training data. Utilizing the limited data available, we here focus on predicting spatial adjacencies (""contact maps”) as a proxy for 3D structure. Our model, BARNACLE, combines the utilization of unlabeled data through self-supervised pre-training and efficient use of the sparse labeled data through an XGBoost classifier. BARNACLE shows a considerable improvement over both the established classical baseline and a deep neural network. In order to demonstrate that our approach can be applied to tasks with similar data constraints, we show that our findings generalize to the related setting of accessible surface area prediction."
255,"Ancient 
Clostridium
 DNA and variants of tetanus neurotoxins associated with human archaeological remains","The analysis of microbial genomes from human archaeological samples offers a historic snapshot of ancient pathogens and provides insights into the origins of modern infectious diseases. Here, we analyze metagenomic datasets from 38 human archaeological samples and identify bacterial genomic sequences related to modern-day 
Clostridium tetani
, which produces the tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) and causes the disease tetanus. These genomic assemblies had varying levels of completeness, and a subset of them displayed hallmarks of ancient DNA damage. Phylogenetic analyses revealed known 
C. tetani
 clades as well as potentially new 
Clostridium
 lineages closely related to 
C. tetani
. The genomic assemblies encode 13 TeNT variants with unique substitution profiles, including a subgroup of TeNT variants found exclusively in ancient samples from South America. We experimentally tested a TeNT variant selected from an ancient Chilean mummy sample and found that it induced tetanus muscle paralysis in mice, with potency comparable to modern TeNT. Thus, our ancient DNA analysis identifies DNA from neurotoxigenic 
C. tetani
 in archaeological human samples, and a novel variant of TeNT that can cause disease in mammals."
256,Evolutionary selection of proteins with two folds,"Although most globular proteins fold into a single stable structure, an increasing number have been shown to remodel their secondary and tertiary structures in response to cellular stimuli. State-of-the-art algorithms predict that these fold-switching proteins adopt only one stable structure, missing their functionally critical alternative folds. Why these algorithms predict a single fold is unclear, but all of them infer protein structure from coevolved amino acid pairs. Here, we hypothesize that coevolutionary signatures are being missed. Suspecting that single-fold variants could be masking these signatures, we developed an approach, called Alternative Contact Enhancement (ACE), to search both highly diverse protein superfamilies–composed of single-fold and fold-switching variants–and protein subfamilies with more fold-switching variants. ACE successfully revealed coevolution of amino acid pairs uniquely corresponding to both conformations of 56/56 fold-switching proteins from distinct families. Then, we used ACE-derived contacts to (1) predict two experimentally consistent conformations of a candidate protein with unsolved structure and (2) develop a blind prediction pipeline for fold-switching proteins. The discovery of widespread dual-fold coevolution indicates that fold-switching sequences have been preserved by natural selection, implying that their functionalities provide evolutionary advantage and paving the way for predictions of diverse protein structures from single sequences."
257,"Single cell multiomic analysis reveals diabetes-associated β-cell heterogeneity driven by 
HNF1A","Broad heterogeneity in pancreatic β-cell function and morphology has been widely reported. However, determining which components of this cellular heterogeneity serve a diabetes-relevant function remains challenging. Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptome, single-nuclei chromatin accessibility, and cell-type specific 3D genome profiles from human islets and identify Type II Diabetes (T2D)-associated β-cell heterogeneity at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. We develop a computational method to explicitly dissect the intra-donor and inter-donor heterogeneity between single β-cells, which reflect distinct mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis. Integrative transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis identifies 
HNF1A
 as a principal driver of intra-donor heterogeneity between β-cells from the same donors; 
HNF1A
 expression is also reduced in β-cells from T2D donors. Interestingly, 
HNF1A
 activity in single β-cells is significantly associated with lower Na+ currents and we nominate a 
HNF1A
 target, 
FXYD2
, as the primary mitigator. Our study demonstrates the value of investigating disease-associated single-cell heterogeneity and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of T2D."
258,"Fine-scale collective movements reveal present, past and future dynamics of a multilevel society in Przewalski’s horses","Studying animal societies needs detailed observation of many individuals, but technological advances offer new opportunities in this field. Here, we present a state-of-the-art drone observation of a multilevel herd of Przewalski’s horses, consisting of harems (one-male, multifemale groups). We track, in high spatio-temporal resolution, the movements of 238 individually identified horses on drone videos, and combine movement analyses with demographic data from two decades of population monitoring. Analysis of collective movements reveals how the structure of the herd’s social network is related to kinship and familiarity of individuals. The network centrality of harems is related to their age and how long the harem stallions have kept harems previously. Harems of genetically related stallions are closer to each other in the network, and female exchange is more frequent between closer harems. High movement similarity of females from different harems predicts becoming harem mates in the future. Our results show that only a few minutes of fine-scale movement tracking combined with high throughput data driven analysis can reveal the structure of a society, reconstruct past group dynamics and predict future ones."
259,Systematic transcriptional analysis of human cell lines for gene expression landscape and tumor representation,"Cell lines are valuable resources as model for human biology and translational medicine. It is thus important to explore the concordance between the expression in various cell lines vis-à-vis human native and disease tissues. In this study, we investigate the expression of all human protein-coding genes in more than 1,000 human cell lines representing 27 cancer types by a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. The cell line gene expression is compared with the corresponding profiles in various tissues, organs, single-cell types and cancers. Here, we present the expression for each cell line and give guidance for the most appropriate cell line for a given experimental study. In addition, we explore the cancer-related pathway and cytokine activity of the cell lines to aid human biology studies and drug development projects. All data are presented in an open access cell line section of the Human Protein Atlas to facilitate the exploration of all human protein-coding genes across these cell lines."
260,Demonstrating paths for unlocking the value of cloud genomics through cross cohort analysis,"Recently, large scale genomic projects such as 
All of Us
 and the UK Biobank have introduced a new research paradigm where data are stored centrally in cloud-based Trusted Research Environments (TREs). To characterize the advantages and drawbacks of different TRE attributes in facilitating cross-cohort analysis, we conduct a Genome-Wide Association Study of standard lipid measures using two approaches: meta-analysis and pooled analysis. Comparison of full summary data from both approaches with an external study shows strong correlation of known loci with lipid levels (R
2
 ~ 83–97%). Importantly, 90 variants meet the significance threshold only in the meta-analysis and 64 variants are significant only in pooled analysis, with approximately 20% of variants in each of those groups being most prevalent in non-European, non-Asian ancestry individuals. These findings have important implications, as technical and policy choices lead to cross-cohort analyses generating similar, but not identical results, particularly for non-European ancestral populations."
261,Placental growth factor exerts a dual function for cardiomyogenesis and vasculogenesis during heart development,"Cardiogenic growth factors play important roles in heart development. Placental growth factor (PLGF) has previously been reported to have angiogenic effects; however, its potential role in cardiogenesis has not yet been determined. We analyze single-cell RNA-sequencing data derived from human and primate embryonic hearts and find PLGF shows a biphasic expression pattern, as it is expressed specifically on ISL1
+
 second heart field progenitors at an earlier stage and on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) at later stages. Using chemically modified mRNAs (modRNAs), we generate a panel of cardiogenic growth factors and test their effects on enhancing cardiomyocyte (CM) and EC induction during different stages of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiations. We discover that only the application of PLGF modRNA at early time points of hESC-CM differentiation can increase both CM and EC production. Conversely, genetic deletion of 
PLGF
 reduces generation of CMs, SMCs and ECs in vitro. We also confirm in vivo beneficial effects of PLGF modRNA for development of human heart progenitor-derived cardiac muscle grafts on murine kidney capsules. Further, we identify the previously unrecognized PLGF-related transcriptional networks driven by EOMES and SOX17. These results shed light on the dual cardiomyogenic and vasculogenic effects of PLGF during heart development."
262,CRUSTY: a versatile web platform for the rapid analysis and visualization of high-dimensional flow cytometry data,"Flow cytometry (FCM) can investigate dozens of parameters from millions of cells and hundreds of specimens in a short time and at a reasonable cost, but the amount of data that is generated is considerable. Computational approaches are useful to identify novel subpopulations and molecular biomarkers, but generally require deep expertize in bioinformatics and the use of different platforms. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CRUSTY, an interactive, user-friendly webtool incorporating the most popular algorithms for FCM data analysis, and capable of visualizing graphical and tabular results and automatically generating publication-quality figures within minutes. CRUSTY also hosts an interactive interface for the exploration of results in real time. Thus, CRUSTY enables a large number of users to mine complex datasets and reduce the time required for data exploration and interpretation. CRUSTY is accessible at

263,The Oncology Biomarker Discovery framework reveals cetuximab and bevacizumab response patterns in metastatic colorectal cancer,"Precision medicine has revolutionised cancer treatments; however, actionable biomarkers remain scarce. To address this, we develop the Oncology Biomarker Discovery (OncoBird) framework for analysing the molecular and biomarker landscape of randomised controlled clinical trials. OncoBird identifies biomarkers based on single genes or mutually exclusive genetic alterations in isolation or in the context of tumour subtypes, and finally, assesses predictive components by their treatment interactions. Here, we utilise the open-label, randomised phase III trial (FIRE-3, AIO KRK-0306) in metastatic colorectal carcinoma patients, who received either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). We systematically identify five biomarkers with predictive components, e.g., patients with tumours that carry chr20q amplifications or lack mutually exclusive ERK signalling mutations benefited from cetuximab compared to bevacizumab. In summary, OncoBird characterises the molecular landscape and outlines actionable biomarkers, which generalises to any molecularly characterised randomised controlled trial."
264,"Impact of dietary interventions on pre-diabetic oral and gut microbiome, metabolites and cytokines","Diabetes and associated comorbidities are a global health threat on the rise. We conducted a six-month dietary intervention in pre-diabetic individuals (NCT03222791), to mitigate the hyperglycemia and enhance metabolic health. The current work explores early diabetes markers in the 200 individuals who completed the trial. We find 166 of 2,803 measured features, including oral and gut microbial species and pathways, serum metabolites and cytokines, show significant change in response to a personalized postprandial glucose-targeting diet or the standard of care Mediterranean diet. These changes include established markers of hyperglycemia as well as novel features that can now be investigated as potential therapeutic targets. Our results indicate the microbiome mediates the effect of diet on glycemic, metabolic and immune measurements, with gut microbiome compositional change explaining 12.25% of serum metabolites variance. Although the gut microbiome displays greater compositional changes compared to the oral microbiome, the oral microbiome demonstrates more changes at the genetic level, with trends dependent on environmental richness and species prevalence in the population. In conclusion, our study shows dietary interventions can affect the microbiome, cardiometabolic profile and immune response of the host, and that these factors are well associated with each other, and can be harnessed for new therapeutic modalities."
265,Interpreting biologically informed neural networks for enhanced proteomic biomarker discovery and pathway analysis,"The incorporation of machine learning methods into proteomics workflows improves the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers and biological pathways. However, machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, typically suffer from lack of interpretability. Here, we present a deep learning approach to combine biological pathway analysis and biomarker identification to increase the interpretability of proteomics experiments. Our approach integrates a priori knowledge of the relationships between proteins and biological pathways and biological processes into sparse neural networks to create biologically informed neural networks. We employ these networks to differentiate between clinical subphenotypes of septic acute kidney injury and COVID-19, as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome of different aetiologies. To gain biological insight into the complex syndromes, we utilize feature attribution-methods to introspect the networks for the identification of proteins and pathways important for distinguishing between subtypes. The algorithms are implemented in a freely available open source Python-package (
https://github.com/InfectionMedicineProteomics/BINN

266,TimeTalk uses single-cell RNA-seq datasets to decipher cell-cell communication during early embryo development,"Early embryonic development is a dynamic process that relies on proper cell-cell communication to form a correctly patterned embryo. Early embryo development-related ligand-receptor pairs (eLRs) have been shown to guide cell fate decisions and morphogenesis. However, the scope of eLRs and their influence on early embryo development remain elusive. Here, we developed a computational framework named TimeTalk from integrated public time-course mouse scRNA-seq datasets to decipher the secret of eLRs. Extensive validations and analyses were performed to ensure the involvement of identified eLRs in early embryo development. Process analysis identified that eLRs could be divided into six temporal windows corresponding to sequential events in the early embryo development process. With the interpolation strategy, TimeTalk is powerful in revealing paracrine settings and studying cell-cell communication during early embryo development. Furthermore, by using TimeTalk in the blastocyst and blastoid models, we found that the blastoid models share the core communication pathways with the epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages in the blastocysts. This result suggests that TimeTalk has transferability to other bio-dynamic processes. We also curated eLRs recognized by TimeTalk, which may provide valuable clues for understanding early embryo development and relevant disorders."
267,Prediction of base editor off-targets by deep learning,"Due to the tolerance of mismatches between gRNA and targeting sequence, base editors frequently induce unwanted Cas9-dependent off-target mutations. Here, to develop models to predict such off-targets, we design gRNA-off- target pairs for adenine base editors (ABEs) and cytosine base editors (CBEs) and stably integrate them into the human cells. After five days of editing, we obtain valid efficiency datasets of 54,663 and 55,727 off-targets for ABEs and CBEs, respectively. We use the datasets to train deep learning models, resulting in ABEdeepoff and CBEdeepoff, which can predict off-target sites. We use these tools to predict off-targets for a panel of endogenous loci and achieve Spearman correlation values varying from 0.710 to 0.859. Finally, we develop an integrated tool that is freely accessible via an online web server 
http://www.deephf.com/#/bedeep/bedeepoff
. These tools could facilitate minimizing the off-target effects of base editing."
268,Deciphering early human pancreas development at the single-cell level,"Understanding pancreas development can provide clues for better treatments of pancreatic diseases. However, the molecular heterogeneity and developmental trajectory of the early human pancreas are poorly explored. Here, we performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing of human embryonic pancreas tissue obtained from first-trimester embryos. We unraveled the molecular heterogeneity, developmental trajectories and regulatory networks of the major cell types. The results reveal that dorsal pancreatic multipotent cells in humans exhibit different gene expression patterns than ventral multipotent cells. Pancreato-biliary progenitors that generate ventral multipotent cells in humans were identified. Notch and MAPK signals from mesenchymal cells regulate the differentiation of multipotent cells into trunk and duct cells. Notably, we identified endocrine progenitor subclusters with different differentiation potentials. Although the developmental trajectories are largely conserved between humans and mice, some distinct gene expression patterns have also been identified. Overall, we provide a comprehensive landscape of early human pancreas development to understand its lineage transitions and molecular complexity."
269,Structure-based design of a strain transcending AMA1-RON2L malaria vaccine,"Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a key malaria vaccine candidate and target of neutralizing antibodies. AMA1 binds to a loop in rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2L) to form the moving junction during parasite invasion of host cells, and this complex is conserved among apicomplexan parasites. AMA1-RON2L complex immunization achieves higher growth inhibitory activity than AMA1 alone and protects mice against 
Plasmodium yoelii
 challenge. Here, three single-component AMA1-RON2L immunogens were designed that retain the structure of the two-component AMA1-RON2L complex: one structure-based design (SBD1) and two insertion fusions. All immunogens elicited high antibody titers with potent growth inhibitory activity, yet these antibodies did not block RON2L binding to AMA1. The SBD1 immunogen induced significantly more potent strain-transcending neutralizing antibody responses against diverse strains of 
Plasmodium falciparum
 than AMA1 or AMA1-RON2L complex vaccination. This indicates that SBD1 directs neutralizing antibody responses to strain-transcending epitopes in AMA1 that are independent of RON2L binding. This work underscores the importance of neutralization mechanisms that are distinct from RON2 blockade. The stable single-component SBD1 immunogen elicits potent strain-transcending protection that may drive the development of next-generation vaccines for improved malaria and apicomplexan parasite control."
270,Removal of false positives in metagenomics-based taxonomy profiling via targeting Type IIB restriction sites,"Accurate species identification and abundance estimation are critical for the interpretation of whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) data. Yet, existing metagenomic profilers suffer from false-positive identifications, which can account for more than 90% of total identified species. Here, by leveraging species-specific Type IIB restriction endonuclease digestion sites as reference instead of universal markers or whole microbial genomes, we present a metagenomic profiler, MAP2B (
M
et
A
genomic 
P
rofiler based on type 
IIB
 restriction sites), to resolve those issues. We first illustrate the pitfalls of using relative abundance as the only feature in determining false positives. We then propose a feature set to distinguish false positives from true positives, and using simulated metagenomes from CAMI2, we establish a false-positive recognition model. By benchmarking the performance in metagenomic profiling using a simulation dataset with varying sequencing depth and species richness, we illustrate the superior performance of MAP2B over existing metagenomic profilers in species identification. We further test the performance of MAP2B using real WMS data from an ATCC mock community, confirming its superior precision against sequencing depth. Finally, by leveraging WMS data from an IBD cohort, we demonstrate the taxonomic features generated by MAP2B can better discriminate IBD and predict metabolomic profiles."
271,Addressing mechanism bias in model-based impact forecasts of new tuberculosis vaccines,"In tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development, multiple factors hinder the design and interpretation of the clinical trials used to estimate vaccine efficacy. The complex transmission chain of TB includes multiple routes to disease, making it hard to link the vaccine efficacy observed in a trial to specific protective mechanisms. Here, we present a Bayesian framework to evaluate the compatibility of different vaccine descriptions with clinical trial outcomes, unlocking impact forecasting from vaccines whose specific mechanisms of action are unknown. Applying our method to the analysis of the M72/AS01
E
 vaccine trial -conducted on IGRA+ individuals- as a case study, we found that most plausible models for this vaccine needed to include protection against, at least, two over the three possible routes to active TB classically considered in the literature: namely, primary TB, latent TB reactivation and TB upon re-infection. Gathering new data regarding the impact of TB vaccines in various epidemiological settings would be instrumental to improve our model estimates of the underlying mechanisms."
272,Transposable elements as tissue-specific enhancers in cancers of endodermal lineage,"Transposable elements (TE) are repetitive genomic elements that harbor binding sites for human transcription factors (TF). A regulatory role for TEs has been suggested in embryonal development and diseases such as cancer but systematic investigation of their functions has been limited by their widespread silencing in the genome. Here, we utilize unbiased massively parallel reporter assay data using a whole human genome library to identify TEs with functional enhancer activity in two human cancer types of endodermal lineage, colorectal and liver cancers. We show that the identified TE enhancers are characterized by genomic features associated with active enhancers, such as epigenetic marks and TF binding. Importantly, we identify distinct TE subfamilies that function as tissue-specific enhancers, namely MER11- and LTR12-elements in colon and liver cancers, respectively. These elements are bound by distinct TFs in each cell type, and they have predicted associations to differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate how different cancer types can utilize distinct TEs as tissue-specific enhancers, paving the way for comprehensive understanding of the role of TEs as bona fide enhancers in the cancer genomes."
273,Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry,"Elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement can worsen cognitive dysfunction in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) patients due to toxins, including possible microbial metabolites, entering the systemic circulation. We conducted untargeted metabolomics on a prospective cohort of 22 patients with cirrhosis undergoing elective TIPS placement and followed them up to one year post TIPS for HE development. Here we suggest that pre-existing intrahepatic shunting predicts HE severity post-TIPS. Bile acid levels decrease in the peripheral vein post-TIPS, and the abundances of three specific conjugated di- and tri-hydroxylated bile acids are inversely correlated with HE grade. Bilirubins and glycerophosphocholines undergo chemical modifications pre- to post-TIPS and based on HE grade. Our results suggest that TIPS-induced metabolome changes can impact HE development, and that pre-existing intrahepatic shunting could be used to predict HE severity post-TIPS."
274,Critical dynamics arise during structured information presentation within embodied in vitro neuronal networks,"Understanding how brains process information is an incredibly difficult task. Amongst the metrics characterising information processing in the brain, observations of dynamic near-critical states have generated significant interest. However, theoretical and experimental limitations associated with human and animal models have precluded a definite answer about when and why neural criticality arises with links from attention, to cognition, and even to consciousness. To explore this topic, we used an in vitro neural network of cortical neurons that was trained to play a simplified game of ‘Pong’ to demonstrate Synthetic Biological Intelligence (SBI). We demonstrate that critical dynamics emerge when neural networks receive task-related structured sensory input, reorganizing the system to a near-critical state. Additionally, better task performance correlated with proximity to critical dynamics. However, criticality alone is insufficient for a neuronal network to demonstrate learning in the absence of additional information regarding the consequences of previous actions. These findings offer compelling support that neural criticality arises as a base feature of incoming structured information processing without the need for higher order cognition."
275,Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Targeted public health interventions for an emerging epidemic are essential for preventing pandemics. During 2020-2022, China invested significant efforts in strict zero-COVID measures to contain outbreaks of varying scales caused by different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on a multi-year empirical dataset containing 131 outbreaks observed in China from April 2020 to May 2022 and simulated scenarios, we ranked the relative intervention effectiveness by their reduction in instantaneous reproduction number. We found that, overall, social distancing measures (38% reduction, 95% prediction interval 31-45%), face masks (30%, 17-42%) and close contact tracing (28%, 24-31%) were most effective. Contact tracing was crucial in containing outbreaks during the initial phases, while social distancing measures became increasingly prominent as the spread persisted. In addition, infections with higher transmissibility and a shorter latent period posed more challenges for these measures. Our findings provide quantitative evidence on the effects of public-health measures for zeroing out emerging contagions in different contexts."
276,"Extrachromosomal circular DNA and structural variants highlight genome instability in 
Arabidopsis
 epigenetic mutants","Abundant extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is associated with transposable element (TE) activity. However, how the eccDNA compartment is controlled by epigenetic regulations and what is its impact on the genome is understudied. Here, using long reads, we sequence both the eccDNA compartment and the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana mutant plants affected in DNA methylation and post-transcriptional gene silencing. We detect a high load of TE-derived eccDNA with truncated and chimeric forms. On the genomic side, on top of truncated and full length TE neo-insertions, we detect complex structural variations (SVs) notably at a disease resistance cluster being a natural hotspot of SV. Finally, we serendipitously identify large tandem duplications in hypomethylated plants, suggesting that SVs could have been overlooked in epigenetic mutants. We propose that a high eccDNA load may alter DNA repair pathways leading to genome instability and the accumulation of SVs, at least in plants."
277,Coordinated single-cell tumor microenvironment dynamics reinforce pancreatic cancer subtype,"Bulk analyses of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples are complicated by the tumor microenvironment (TME), i.e. signals from fibroblasts, endocrine, exocrine, and immune cells. Despite this, we and others have established tumor and stroma subtypes with prognostic significance. However, understanding of underlying signals driving distinct immune and stromal landscapes is still incomplete. Here we integrate 92 single cell RNA-seq samples from seven independent studies to build a reproducible PDAC atlas with a focus on tumor-TME interdependence. Patients with activated stroma are synonymous with higher myofibroblastic and immunogenic fibroblasts, and furthermore show increased M2-like macrophages and regulatory T-cells. Contrastingly, patients with ‘normal’ stroma show M1-like recruitment, elevated effector and exhausted T-cells. To aid interoperability of future studies, we provide a pretrained cell type classifier and an atlas of subtype-based signaling factors that we also validate in mouse data. Ultimately, this work leverages the heterogeneity among single-cell studies to create a comprehensive view of the orchestra of signaling interactions governing PDAC."
278,Projecting RNA measurements onto single cell atlases to extract cell type-specific expression profiles using scProjection,"Multi-modal single cell RNA assays capture RNA content as well as other data modalities, such as spatial cell position or the electrophysiological properties of cells. Compared to dedicated scRNA-seq assays however, they may unintentionally capture RNA from multiple adjacent cells, exhibit lower RNA sequencing depth compared to scRNA-seq, or lack genome-wide RNA measurements. We present scProjection, a method for mapping individual multi-modal RNA measurements to deeply sequenced scRNA-seq atlases to extract cell type-specific, single cell gene expression profiles. We demonstrate several use cases of scProjection, including identifying spatial motifs from spatial transcriptome assays, distinguishing RNA contributions from neighboring cells in both spatial and multi-modal single cell assays, and imputing expression measurements of un-measured genes from gene markers. scProjection therefore combines the advantages of both multi-modal and scRNA-seq assays to yield precise multi-modal measurements of single cells."
279,Integration of pre-trained protein language models into geometric deep learning networks,"Geometric deep learning has recently achieved great success in non-Euclidean domains, and learning on 3D structures of large biomolecules is emerging as a distinct research area. However, its efficacy is largely constrained due to the limited quantity of structural data. Meanwhile, protein language models trained on substantial 1D sequences have shown burgeoning capabilities with scale in a broad range of applications. Several preceding studies consider combining these different protein modalities to promote the representation power of geometric neural networks but fail to present a comprehensive understanding of their benefits. In this work, we integrate the knowledge learned by well-trained protein language models into several state-of-the-art geometric networks and evaluate a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including protein-protein interface prediction, model quality assessment, protein-protein rigid-body docking, and binding affinity prediction. Our findings show an overall improvement of 20% over baselines. Strong evidence indicates that the incorporation of protein language models’ knowledge enhances geometric networks’ capacity by a significant margin and can be generalized to complex tasks."
280,Identifying the serious clinical outcomes of adverse reactions to drugs by a multi-task deep learning framework,"Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) have a direct impact on human health. As continuous pharmacovigilance and drug monitoring prove to be costly and time-consuming, computational methods have emerged as promising alternatives. However, most existing computational methods primarily focus on predicting whether or not the drug is associated with an adverse reaction and do not consider the core issue of drug benefit-risk assessment—whether the treatment outcome is serious when adverse drug reactions occur. To this end, we categorize serious clinical outcomes caused by adverse reactions to drugs into seven distinct classes and present a deep learning framework, so-called GCAP, for predicting the seriousness of clinical outcomes of adverse reactions to drugs. GCAP has two tasks: one is to predict whether adverse reactions to drugs cause serious clinical outcomes, and the other is to infer the corresponding classes of serious clinical outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is a powerful and robust framework with high extendibility. GCAP can serve as a useful tool to successfully address the challenge of predicting the seriousness of clinical outcomes stemming from adverse reactions to drugs."
281,Combined computational modeling and experimental study of the biomechanical mechanisms of platelet-driven contraction of fibrin clots,"While blood clot formation has been relatively well studied, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the subsequent structural and mechanical clot remodeling called 
contraction
 or 
retraction
. Impairment of the clot contraction process is associated with both life-threatening bleeding and thrombotic conditions, such as ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and others. Recently, blood clot contraction was observed to be hindered in patients with COVID-19. A three-dimensional multiscale computational model is developed and used to quantify biomechanical mechanisms of the kinetics of clot contraction driven by platelet-fibrin pulling interactions. These results provide important biological insights into contraction of platelet filopodia, the mechanically active thin protrusions of the plasma membrane, described previously as performing mostly a sensory function. The biomechanical mechanisms and modeling approach described can potentially apply to studying other systems in which cells are embedded in a filamentous network and exert forces on the extracellular matrix modulated by the substrate stiffness."
282,Thermodynamic principle to enhance enzymatic activity using the substrate affinity,"Understanding how to tune enzymatic activity is important not only for biotechnological applications, but also to elucidate the basic principles guiding the design and optimization of biological systems in nature. So far, the Michaelis-Menten equation has provided a fundamental framework of enzymatic activity. However, there is still no concrete guideline on how the parameters should be optimized towards higher activity. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the Michaelis-Menten constant (
\({K}_{m}\)
) to the substrate concentration (
\([{{{{{\rm{S}}}}}}]\)
) enhances enzymatic activity. This guideline (
\({K}_{m}=[{{{{{\rm{S}}}}}}]\)
) was obtained mathematically by assuming that thermodynamically favorable reactions have higher rate constants, and that the total driving force is fixed. Due to the generality of these thermodynamic considerations, we propose 
\({K}_{m}=[{{{{{\rm{S}}}}}}]\)
 as a general concept to enhance enzymatic activity. Our bioinformatic analysis reveals that the 
\({K}_{m}\)
 and in vivo substrate concentrations are consistent across a dataset of approximately 1000 enzymes, suggesting that even natural selection follows the principle

283,Data-mining unveils structure–property–activity correlation of viral infectivity enhancing self-assembling peptides,"Gene therapy via retroviral vectors holds great promise for treating a variety of serious diseases. It requires the use of additives to boost infectivity. Amyloid-like peptide nanofibers (PNFs) were shown to efficiently enhance retroviral gene transfer. However, the underlying mode of action of these peptides remains largely unknown. Data-mining is an efficient method to systematically study structure–function relationship and unveil patterns in a database. This data-mining study elucidates the multi-scale structure–property–activity relationship of transduction enhancing peptides for retroviral gene transfer. In contrast to previous reports, we find that not the amyloid fibrils themselves, but rather µm-sized β-sheet rich aggregates enhance infectivity. Specifically, microscopic aggregation of β-sheet rich amyloid structures with a hydrophobic surface pattern and positive surface charge are identified as key material properties. We validate the reliability of the amphiphilic sequence pattern and the general applicability of the key properties by rationally creating new active sequences and identifying short amyloidal peptides from various pathogenic and functional origin. Data-mining—even for small datasets—enables the development of new efficient retroviral transduction enhancers and provides important insights into the diverse bioactivity of the functional material class of amyloids."
284,Bile acid-dependent transcription factors and chromatin accessibility determine regional heterogeneity of intestinal antimicrobial peptides,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important mediators of intestinal immune surveillance. However, the regional heterogeneity of AMPs and its regulatory mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we clarified the regional heterogeneity of intestinal AMPs at the single-cell level, and revealed a cross-lineages AMP regulation mechanism that bile acid dependent transcription factors (BATFs), 
NR1H4
, 
NR1H3
 and 
VDR
, regulate AMPs through a ligand-independent manner. Bile acids regulate AMPs by perturbing cell differentiation rather than activating BATFs signaling. Chromatin accessibility determines the potential of BATFs to regulate AMPs at the pre-transcriptional level, thus shaping the regional heterogeneity of AMPs. The BATFs-AMPs axis also participates in the establishment of intestinal antimicrobial barriers of fetuses and the defects of antibacterial ability during Crohn’s disease. Overall, BATFs and chromatin accessibility play essential roles in shaping the regional heterogeneity of AMPs at pre- and postnatal stages, as well as in maintenance of antimicrobial immunity during homeostasis and disease."
285,"Structural insights into opposing actions of neurosteroids on GABA
A
 receptors","γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA
A
) receptors mediate fast inhibitory signaling in the brain and are targets of numerous drugs and endogenous neurosteroids. A subset of neurosteroids are GABA
A
 receptor positive allosteric modulators; one of these, allopregnanolone, is the only drug approved specifically for treating postpartum depression. There is a consensus emerging from structural, physiological and photolabeling studies as to where positive modulators bind, but how they potentiate GABA activation remains unclear. Other neurosteroids are negative modulators of GABA
A
 receptors, but their binding sites remain debated. Here we present structures of a synaptic GABA
A
 receptor bound to allopregnanolone and two inhibitory sulfated neurosteroids. Allopregnanolone binds at the receptor-bilayer interface, in the consensus potentiator site. In contrast, inhibitory neurosteroids bind in the pore. MD simulations and electrophysiology support a mechanism by which allopregnanolone potentiates channel activity and suggest the dominant mechanism for sulfated neurosteroid inhibition is through pore block."
286,Genetic analysis of blood molecular phenotypes reveals common properties in the regulatory networks affecting complex traits,"We evaluate the shared genetic regulation of mRNA molecules, proteins and metabolites derived from whole blood from 3029 human donors. We find abundant allelic heterogeneity, where multiple variants regulate a particular molecular phenotype, and pleiotropy, where a single variant associates with multiple molecular phenotypes over multiple genomic regions. The highest proportion of share genetic regulation is detected between gene expression and proteins (66.6%), with a further median shared genetic associations across 49 different tissues of 78.3% and 62.4% between plasma proteins and gene expression. We represent the genetic and molecular associations in networks including 2828 known GWAS variants, showing that GWAS variants are more often connected to gene expression in trans than other molecular phenotypes in the network. Our work provides a roadmap to understanding molecular networks and deriving the underlying mechanism of action of GWAS variants using different molecular phenotypes in an accessible tissue."

288,VHH CDR-H3 conformation is determined by VH germline usage,"VHHs or nanobodies are single antigen binding domains originating from camelid heavy-chain antibodies. They are used as diagnostic and research tools and in a variety of therapeutic molecules. Analyzing variable domain structures from llama and alpaca we found that VHHs can be classified into two large structural clusters based on their CDR-H3 conformation. Extended CDR-H3 loops protrude into the solvent, whereas kinked CDR-H3 loops fold back onto framework regions. Both major families have distinct properties in terms of their CDR-H3 secondary structure, how their CDR-H3 interacts with the framework region and how they bind to antigens. We show that the CDR-H3 conformation of VHHs correlates with the germline from which the antibodies are derived: IGHV3-3 derived antibodies almost exclusively adopt a kinked CDR-H3 conformation while the CDR-H3 adopts an extended structure in most IGHV3S53 derived antibodies. We do not observe any bias stemming from V(D)J recombination in llama immune repertoires, suggesting that the correlation is the result of selection processes during B-cell development. Our findings demonstrate a previously undescribed impact of germline usage on antigen interaction and contribute to a better understanding on how properties of the antibody framework shape the immune repertoire."

). The pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of a CD98hc antibody transport vehicle (ATV
CD98hc
) are assessed in humanized CD98hc knock-in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Compared to most existing BBB platforms targeting the transferrin receptor, peripherally administered ATV
CD98hc
 demonstrates differentiated brain delivery with markedly slower and more prolonged kinetic properties. Specific biodistribution profiles within the brain parenchyma can be modulated by introducing Fc mutations on ATV
CD98hc
 that impact FcγR engagement, changing the valency of CD98hc binding, and by altering the extent of target engagement with Fabs. Our study establishes TV
CD98hc
 as a modular brain delivery platform with favorable kinetic, biodistribution, and safety properties distinct from previously reported BBB platforms."
290,APOGEE 2: multi-layer machine-learning model for the interpretable prediction of mitochondrial missense variants,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has pleiotropic effects and is frequently caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations. However, factors such as significant variability in clinical manifestations make interpreting the pathogenicity of variants in the mitochondrial genome challenging. Here, we present APOGEE 2, a mitochondrially-centered ensemble method designed to improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions for interpreting missense mitochondrial variants. Built on the joint consensus recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology, APOGEE 2 features an improved machine learning method and a curated training set for enhanced performance metrics. It offers region-wise assessments of genome fragility and mechanistic analyses of specific amino acids that cause perceptible long-range effects on protein structure. With clinical and research use in mind, APOGEE 2 scores and pathogenicity probabilities are precompiled and available in MitImpact. APOGEE 2’s ability to address challenges in interpreting mitochondrial missense variants makes it an essential tool in the field of mitochondrial genetics."
291,"iCLOTS: open-source, artificial intelligence-enabled software for analyses of blood cells in microfluidic and microscopy-based assays","While microscopy-based cellular assays, including microfluidics, have significantly advanced over the last several decades, there has not been concurrent development of widely-accessible techniques to analyze time-dependent microscopy data incorporating phenomena such as fluid flow and dynamic cell adhesion. As such, experimentalists typically rely on error-prone and time-consuming manual analysis, resulting in lost resolution and missed opportunities for innovative metrics. We present a user-adaptable toolkit packaged into the open-source, standalone Interactive Cellular assay Labeled Observation and Tracking Software (iCLOTS). We benchmark cell adhesion, single-cell tracking, velocity profile, and multiscale microfluidic-centric applications with blood samples, the prototypical biofluid specimen. Moreover, machine learning algorithms characterize previously imperceptible data groupings from numerical outputs. Free to download/use, iCLOTS addresses a need for a field stymied by a lack of analytical tools for innovative, physiologically-relevant assays of any design, democratizing use of well-validated algorithms for all end-user biomedical researchers who would benefit from advanced computational methods."
292,The net electrostatic potential and hydration of ABCG2 affect substrate transport,"ABCG2 is a medically important ATP-binding cassette transporter with crucial roles in the absorption and distribution of chemically-diverse toxins and drugs, reducing the cellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs to facilitate multidrug resistance in cancer. ABCG2’s capacity to transport both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds is not well understood. Here we assess the molecular basis for substrate discrimination by the binding pocket. Substitution of a phylogenetically-conserved polar residue, N436, to alanine in the binding pocket of human ABCG2 permits only hydrophobic substrate transport, revealing the unique role of N436 as a discriminator. Molecular dynamics simulations show that this alanine substitution alters the electrostatic potential of the binding pocket favoring hydration of the transport pore. This change affects the contact with substrates and inhibitors, abrogating hydrophilic compound transport while retaining the transport of hydrophobic compounds. The N436 residue is also required for optimal transport inhibition of ABCG2, as many inhibitors are functionally impaired by this ABCG2 mutation. Overall, these findings have biomedical implications, broadly extending our understanding of substrate and inhibitor interactions."
293,Alignment of spatial genomics data using deep Gaussian processes,"Spatially resolved genomic technologies have allowed us to study the physical organization of cells and tissues, and promise an understanding of local interactions between cells. However, it remains difficult to precisely align spatial observations across slices, samples, scales, individuals and technologies. Here, we propose a probabilistic model that aligns spatially-resolved samples onto a known or unknown common coordinate system (CCS) with respect to phenotypic readouts (for example, gene expression). Our method, Gaussian Process Spatial Alignment (GPSA), consists of a two-layer Gaussian process: the first layer maps observed samples’ spatial locations onto a CCS, and the second layer maps from the CCS to the observed readouts. Our approach enables complex downstream spatially aware analyses that are impossible or inaccurate with unaligned data, including an analysis of variance, creation of a dense three-dimensional (3D) atlas from sparse two-dimensional (2D) slices or association tests across data modalities."
294,A deep learning method for replicate-based analysis of chromosome conformation contacts using Siamese neural networks,"The organisation of the genome in nuclear space is an important frontier of biology. Chromosome conformation capture methods such as Hi-C and Micro-C produce genome-wide chromatin contact maps that provide rich data containing quantitative and qualitative information about genome architecture. Most conventional approaches to genome-wide chromosome conformation capture data are limited to the analysis of pre-defined features, and may therefore miss important biological information. One constraint is that biologically important features can be masked by high levels of technical noise in the data. Here we introduce a replicate-based method for deep learning from chromatin conformation contact maps. Using a Siamese network configuration our approach learns to distinguish technical noise from biological variation and outperforms image similarity metrics across a range of biological systems. The features extracted from Hi-C maps after perturbation of cohesin and CTCF reflect the distinct biological functions of cohesin and CTCF in the formation of domains and boundaries, respectively. The learnt distance metrics are biologically meaningful, as they mirror the density of cohesin and CTCF binding. These properties make our method a powerful tool for the exploration of chromosome conformation capture data, such as Hi-C capture Hi-C, and Micro-C."
295,Transcriptional profiling of canine osteosarcoma identifies prognostic gene expression signatures with translational value for humans,"Canine osteosarcoma is increasingly recognized as an informative model for human osteosarcoma. Here we show in one of the largest clinically annotated canine osteosarcoma transcriptional datasets that two previously reported, as well as de novo gene signatures devised through single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), have prognostic utility in both human and canine patients. Shared molecular pathway alterations are seen in immune cell signaling and activation including TH1 and TH2 signaling, interferon signaling, and inflammatory responses. Virtual cell sorting to estimate immune cell populations within canine and human tumors showed similar trends, predominantly for macrophages and CD8+ T cells. Immunohistochemical staining verified the increased presence of immune cells in tumors exhibiting immune gene enrichment. Collectively these findings further validate naturally occurring osteosarcoma of the pet dog as a translationally relevant patient model for humans and improve our understanding of the immunologic and genomic landscape of the disease in both species."
296,Single-cell genomics improves the discovery of risk variants and genes of atrial fibrillation,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked hundreds of loci to cardiac diseases. However, in most loci the causal variants and their target genes remain unknown. We developed a combined experimental and analytical approach that integrates single cell epigenomics with GWAS to prioritize risk variants and genes. We profiled accessible chromatin in single cells obtained from human hearts and leveraged the data to study genetics of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Enrichment analysis of AF risk variants using cell-type-resolved open chromatin regions (OCRs) implicated cardiomyocytes as the main mediator of AF risk. We then performed statistical fine-mapping, leveraging the information in OCRs, and identified putative causal variants in 122 AF-associated loci. Taking advantage of the fine-mapping results, our novel statistical procedure for gene discovery prioritized 46 high-confidence risk genes, highlighting transcription factors and signal transduction pathways important for heart development. In summary, our analysis provides a comprehensive map of AF risk variants and genes, and a general framework to integrate single-cell genomics with genetic studies of complex traits."
297,Whole genome deconvolution unveils Alzheimer’s resilient epigenetic signature,"Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) accurately depicts the chromatin regulatory state and altered mechanisms guiding gene expression in disease. However, bulk sequencing entangles information from different cell types and obscures cellular heterogeneity. To address this, we developed Cellformer, a deep learning method that deconvolutes bulk ATAC-seq into cell type-specific expression across the whole genome. Cellformer enables cost-effective cell type-specific open chromatin profiling in large cohorts. Applied to 191 bulk samples from 3 brain regions, Cellformer identifies cell type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms involved in resilience to Alzheimer’s disease, an uncommon group of cognitively healthy individuals that harbor a high pathological load of Alzheimer’s disease. Cell type-resolved chromatin profiling unveils cell type-specific pathways and nominates potential epigenetic mediators underlying resilience that may illuminate therapeutic opportunities to limit the cognitive impact of the disease. Cellformer is freely available to facilitate future investigations using high-throughput bulk ATAC-seq data."
298,Global endometrial DNA methylation analysis reveals insights into mQTL regulation and associated endometriosis disease risk and endometrial function,"Endometriosis is a leading cause of pain and infertility affecting millions of women globally. Herein, we characterize variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) and its association with menstrual cycle phase, endometriosis, and genetic variants through analysis of genotype data and methylation in endometrial samples from 984 deeply-phenotyped participants. We estimate that 15.4% of the variation in endometriosis is captured by DNAm and identify significant differences in DNAm profiles associated with stage III/IV endometriosis, endometriosis sub-phenotypes and menstrual cycle phase, including opening of the window for embryo implantation. Menstrual cycle phase was a major source of DNAm variation suggesting cellular and hormonally-driven changes across the cycle can regulate genes and pathways responsible for endometrial physiology and function. DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis identified 118,185 independent 
cis
-mQTLs including 51 associated with risk of endometriosis, highlighting candidate genes contributing to disease risk. Our work provides functional evidence for epigenetic targets contributing to endometriosis risk and pathogenesis. Data generated serve as a valuable resource for understanding tissue-specific effects of methylation on endometrial biology in health and disease."
299,Deep transfer learning for inter-chain contact predictions of transmembrane protein complexes,"Membrane proteins are encoded by approximately a quarter of human genes. Inter-chain residue-residue contact information is important for structure prediction of membrane protein complexes and valuable for understanding their molecular mechanism. Although many deep learning methods have been proposed to predict the intra-protein contacts or helix-helix interactions in membrane proteins, it is still challenging to accurately predict their inter-chain contacts due to the limited number of transmembrane proteins. Addressing the challenge, here we develop a deep transfer learning method for predicting inter-chain contacts of transmembrane protein complexes, named DeepTMP, by taking advantage of the knowledge pre-trained from a large data set of non-transmembrane proteins. DeepTMP utilizes a geometric triangle-aware module to capture the correct inter-chain interaction from the coevolution information generated by protein language models. DeepTMP is extensively evaluated on a test set of 52 self-associated transmembrane protein complexes, and compared with state-of-the-art methods including DeepHomo2.0, CDPred, GLINTER, DeepHomo, and DNCON2_Inter. It is shown that DeepTMP considerably improves the precision of inter-chain contact prediction and outperforms the existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness."
300,COMPASS: joint copy number and mutation phylogeny reconstruction from amplicon single-cell sequencing data,"Reconstructing the history of somatic DNA alterations can help understand the evolution of a tumor and predict its resistance to treatment. Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) can be used to investigate clonal heterogeneity and to inform phylogeny reconstruction. However, most existing phylogenetic methods for scDNAseq data are designed either for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or for large copy number alterations (CNAs), or are not applicable to targeted sequencing. Here, we develop COMPASS, a computational method for inferring the joint phylogeny of SNVs and CNAs from targeted scDNAseq data. We evaluate COMPASS on simulated data and apply it to several datasets including a cohort of 123 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. COMPASS detected clonal CNAs that could be orthogonally validated with bulk data, in addition to subclonal ones that require single-cell resolution, some of which point toward convergent evolution."
301,"Single-cell profiling of 
Anopheles gambiae
 spermatogenesis defines the onset of meiotic silencing and premeiotic overexpression of the X chromosome","Understanding development and genetic regulation in the 
Anopheles gambiae
 germline is essential to engineer effective genetic control strategies targeting this malaria mosquito vector. These include targeting the germline to induce sterility or using regulatory sequences to drive transgene expression for applications such as gene drive. However, only very few germline-specific regulatory elements have been characterised with the majority showing leaky expression. This has been shown to considerably reduce the efficiency of current genetic control strategies, which rely on regulatory elements with more tightly restricted spatial and/or temporal expression. Meiotic silencing of the sex chromosomes limits the flexibility of transgene expression to develop effective sex-linked genetic control strategies. Here, we build on our previous study, dissecting gametogenesis into four distinct cell populations, using single-cell RNA sequencing to define eight distinct cell clusters and associated germline cell–types using available marker genes. We reveal overexpression of X-linked genes in a distinct cluster of pre-meiotic cells and document the onset of meiotic silencing of the X chromosome in a subcluster of cells in the latter stages of spermatogenesis. This study provides a comprehensive dataset, characterising the expression of distinct cell types through spermatogenesis and widening the toolkit for genetic control of malaria mosquitoes."
302,Fast kernel-based association testing of non-linear genetic effects for biobank-scale data,"Our knowledge of non-linear genetic effects on complex traits remains limited, in part, due to the modest power to detect such effects. While kernel-based tests offer a versatile approach to test for non-linear relationships between sets of genetic variants and traits, current approaches cannot be applied to Biobank-scale datasets containing hundreds of thousands of individuals. We propose, FastKAST, a kernel-based approach that can test for non-linear effects of a set of variants on a quantitative trait. FastKAST provides calibrated hypothesis tests while enabling analysis of Biobank-scale datasets with hundreds of thousands of unrelated individuals from a homogeneous population. We apply FastKAST to 53 quantitative traits measured across ≈ 300 K unrelated white British individuals in the UK Biobank to detect sets of variants with non-linear effects at genome-wide significance."
303,UniAligner: a parameter-free framework for fast sequence alignment,"Even though the recent advances in ‘complete genomics’ revealed the previously inaccessible genomic regions, analysis of variations in centromeres and other extra-long tandem repeats (ETRs) faces an algorithmic challenge since there are currently no tools for accurate sequence comparison of ETRs. Counterintuitively, the classical alignment approaches, such as the Smith–Waterman algorithm, fail to construct biologically adequate alignments of ETRs. We present UniAligner—the parameter-free sequence alignment algorithm with sequence-dependent alignment scoring that automatically changes for any pair of compared sequences. UniAligner prioritizes matches of rare substrings that are more likely to be relevant to the evolutionary relationship between two sequences. We apply UniAligner to estimate the mutation rates in human centromeres, and quantify the extremely high rate of large duplications and deletions in centromeres. This high rate suggests that centromeres may represent some of the most rapidly evolving regions of the human genome with respect to their structural organization."
304,"Identification of gene function based on models capturing natural variability of 
Arabidopsis thaliana
 lipid metabolism","Lipids play fundamental roles in regulating agronomically important traits. Advances in plant lipid metabolism have until recently largely been based on reductionist approaches, although modulation of its components can have system-wide effects. However, existing models of plant lipid metabolism provide lumped representations, hindering detailed study of component modulation. Here, we present the Plant Lipid Module (PLM) which provides a mechanistic description of lipid metabolism in the 
Arabidopsis thaliana
 rosette. We demonstrate that the PLM can be readily integrated in models of 
A. thaliana
 Col-0 metabolism, yielding accurate predictions (83%) of single lethal knock-outs and 75% concordance between measured transcript and predicted flux changes under extended darkness. Genome-wide associations with fluxes obtained by integrating the PLM in diel condition- and accession-specific models identify up to 65 candidate genes modulating 
A. thaliana
 lipid metabolism. Using mutant lines, we validate up to 40% of the candidates, paving the way for identification of metabolic gene function based on models capturing natural variability in metabolism."
305,"Systematic review of cnidarian microbiomes reveals insights into the structure, specificity, and fidelity of marine associations","Microorganisms play essential roles in the health and resilience of cnidarians. Understanding the factors influencing cnidarian microbiomes requires cross study comparisons, yet the plethora of protocols used hampers dataset integration. We unify 16S rRNA gene sequences from cnidarian microbiome studies under a single analysis pipeline. We reprocess 12,010 cnidarian microbiome samples from 186 studies, alongside 3,388 poriferan, 370 seawater samples, and 245 cultured Symbiodiniaceae, unifying ~6.5 billion sequence reads. Samples are partitioned by hypervariable region and sequencing platform to reduce sequencing variability. This systematic review uncovers an incredible diversity of 86 archaeal and bacterial phyla associated with Cnidaria, and highlights key bacteria hosted across host sub-phylum, depth, and microhabitat. Shallow (< 30 m) water Alcyonacea and Actinaria are characterized by highly shared and relatively abundant microbial communities, unlike Scleractinia and most deeper cnidarians. Utilizing the V4 region, we find that cnidarian microbial composition, richness, diversity, and structure are primarily influenced by host phylogeny, sampling depth, and ocean body, followed by microhabitat and sampling date. We identify host and geographical generalist and specific 
Endozoicomonas
 clades within Cnidaria and Porifera. This systematic review forms a framework for understanding factors governing cnidarian microbiomes and creates a baseline for assessing stress associated dysbiosis."
306,Characterizing cancer metabolism from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data using METAFlux,"Cells often alter metabolic strategies under nutrient-deprived conditions to support their survival and growth. Characterizing metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is of emerging importance in cancer research and patient care. However, recent technologies only measure a subset of metabolites and cannot provide in situ measurements. Computational methods such as flux balance analysis (FBA) have been developed to estimate metabolic flux from bulk RNA-seq data and can potentially be extended to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. However, it is unclear how reliable current methods are, particularly in TME characterization. Here, we present a computational framework METAFlux (METAbolic Flux balance analysis) to infer metabolic fluxes from bulk or single-cell transcriptomic data. Large-scale experiments using cell-lines, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and scRNA-seq data obtained from diverse cancer and immunotherapeutic contexts, including CAR-NK cell therapy, have validated METAFlux’s capability to characterize metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interaction amongst cell types."
307,SnapFISH: a computational pipeline to identify chromatin loops from multiplexed DNA FISH data,"Multiplexed DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging technologies have been developed to map the folding of chromatin fibers at tens of nanometers and up to several kilobases in resolution in single cells. However, computational methods to reliably identify chromatin loops from such imaging datasets are still lacking. Here we present a Single-Nucleus Analysis Pipeline for multiplexed DNA FISH (SnapFISH), to process the multiplexed DNA FISH data and identify chromatin loops. SnapFISH can identify known chromatin loops from mouse embryonic stem cells with high sensitivity and accuracy. In addition, SnapFISH obtains comparable results of chromatin loops across datasets generated from diverse imaging technologies. SnapFISH is freely available at

308,Domain loss enabled evolution of novel functions in the snake three-finger toxin gene superfamily,"Three-finger toxins (
3FTXs
) are a functionally diverse family of toxins, apparently unique to venoms of caenophidian snakes. Although the ancestral function of 3FTXs is antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, redundancy conferred by the accumulation of duplicate genes has facilitated extensive neofunctionalization, such that derived members of the family interact with a range of targets. 3FTXs are members of the LY6/UPAR family, but their non-toxin ancestor remains unknown. Combining traditional phylogenetic approaches, manual synteny analysis, and machine learning techniques (including 
AlphaFold2
 and 
ProtT5
), we have reconstructed a detailed evolutionary history of 3FTXs. We identify their immediate ancestor as a non-secretory LY6, unique to squamate reptiles, and propose that changes in molecular ecology resulting from loss of a membrane-anchoring domain and changes in gene expression, paved the way for the evolution of one of the most important families of snake toxins."
309,Cell-type-specific co-expression inference from single cell RNA-sequencing data,"The advancement of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled the direct inference of co-expressions in specific cell types, facilitating our understanding of cell-type-specific biological functions. For this task, the high sequencing depth variations and measurement errors in scRNA-seq data present two significant challenges, and they have not been adequately addressed by existing methods. We propose a statistical approach, CS-CORE, for estimating and testing cell-type-specific co-expressions, that explicitly models sequencing depth variations and measurement errors in scRNA-seq data. Systematic evaluations show that most existing methods suffered from inflated false positives as well as biased co-expression estimates and clustering analysis, whereas CS-CORE gave accurate estimates in these experiments. When applied to scRNA-seq data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer’s disease patients/controls and blood samples from COVID-19 patients/controls, CS-CORE identified cell-type-specific co-expressions and differential co-expressions that were more reproducible and/or more enriched for relevant biological pathways than those inferred from existing methods."
310,Brain mitochondrial diversity and network organization predict anxiety-like behavior in male mice,"The brain and behavior are under energetic constraints, limited by mitochondrial energy transformation capacity. However, the mitochondria-behavior relationship has not been systematically studied at a brain-wide scale. Here we examined the association between multiple features of mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and stress-related behaviors in male mice with diverse behavioral phenotypes. Miniaturized assays of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content were deployed on 571 samples across 17 brain areas, defining specific patterns of mito-behavior associations. By applying multi-slice network analysis to our brain-wide mitochondrial dataset, we identified three large-scale networks of brain areas with shared mitochondrial signatures. A major network composed of cortico-striatal areas exhibited the strongest mitochondria-behavior correlations, accounting for up to 50% of animal-to-animal behavioral differences, suggesting that this mito-based network is functionally significant. The mito-based brain networks also overlapped with regional gene expression and structural connectivity, and exhibited distinct molecular mitochondrial phenotype signatures. This work provides convergent multimodal evidence anchored in enzyme activities, gene expression, and animal behavior that distinct, behaviorally-relevant mitochondrial phenotypes exist across the male mouse brain."
311,A machine-learning approach to human ex vivo lung perfusion predicts transplantation outcomes and promotes organ utilization,"Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a data-intensive platform used for the assessment of isolated lungs outside the body for transplantation; however, the integration of artificial intelligence to rapidly interpret the large constellation of clinical data generated during ex vivo assessment remains an unmet need. We developed a machine-learning model, termed 
InsighTx
, to predict post-transplant outcomes using n = 725 EVLP cases. InsighTx model AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) was 79 ± 3%, 75 ± 4%, and 85 ± 3% in training and independent test datasets, respectively. Excellent performance was observed in predicting unsuitable lungs for transplantation (AUROC: 90 ± 4%) and transplants with good outcomes (AUROC: 80 ± 4%). In a retrospective and blinded implementation study by EVLP specialists at our institution, InsighTx increased the likelihood of transplanting suitable donor lungs [odds ratio=13; 95% CI:4-45] and decreased the likelihood of transplanting unsuitable donor lungs [odds ratio=0.4; 95%CI:0.16–0.98]. Herein, we provide strong rationale for the adoption of machine-learning algorithms to optimize EVLP assessments and show that InsighTx could potentially lead to a safe increase in transplantation rates."
312,Cross-species transcriptomics reveals bifurcation point during the arterial-to-hemogenic transition,"Hemogenic endothelium (HE) with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-forming potential emerge from specialized arterial endothelial cells (AECs) undergoing the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Characterization of this AECs subpopulation and whether this phenomenon is conserved across species remains unclear. Here we introduce HomologySeeker, a cross-species method that leverages refined 
mouse
 information to explore under-studied 
human
 EHT. Utilizing single-cell transcriptomic ensembles of EHT, HomologySeeker reveals a parallel developmental relationship between these two species, with minimal pre-HSC signals observed in 
human
 cells. The pre-HE stage contains a conserved bifurcation point between the two species, where cells progress towards HE or late AECs. By harnessing 
human
 spatial transcriptomics, we identify ligand modules that contribute to the bifurcation choice and validate CXCL12 in promoting hemogenic choice using a 
human
 in vitro differentiation system. Our findings advance 
human
 arterial-to-hemogenic transition understanding and offer valuable insights for manipulating HSC generation using in vitro models."
313,The pharmacoepigenomic landscape of cancer cell lines reveals the epigenetic component of drug sensitivity,"Aberrant DNA methylation accompanies genetic alterations during oncogenesis and tumour homeostasis and contributes to the transcriptional deregulation of key signalling pathways in cancer. Despite increasing efforts in DNA methylation profiling of cancer patients, there is still a lack of epigenetic biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy. To address this, we analyse 721 cancer cell lines across 22 cancer types treated with 453 anti-cancer compounds. We systematically detect the predictive component of DNA methylation in the context of transcriptional and mutational patterns, i.e., in total 19 DNA methylation biomarkers across 17 drugs and five cancer types. DNA methylation constitutes drug sensitivity biomarkers by mediating the expression of proximal genes, thereby enhancing biological signals across multi-omics data modalities. Our method reproduces anticipated associations, and in addition, we find that the 
NEK9
 promoter hypermethylation may confer sensitivity to the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat in melanoma through downregulation of 
NEK9
. In summary, we envision that epigenomics will refine existing patient stratification, thus empowering the next generation of precision oncology."
314,DichroIDP: a method for analyses of intrinsically disordered proteins using circular dichroism spectroscopy,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are comprised of significant numbers of residues that form neither helix, sheet, nor any other canonical type of secondary structure. They play important roles in a broad range of biological processes, such as molecular recognition and signalling, largely due to their chameleon-like ability to change structure from unordered when free in solution to ordered when bound to partner molecules. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a widely-used method for characterising protein secondary structures, but analyses of IDPs using CD spectroscopy have suffered because the methods and reference datasets used for the empirical determination of secondary structures do not contain adequate representations of unordered structures. This work describes the creation, validation and testing of a standalone Windows-based application, DichroIDP, and a new reference dataset, IDP175, which is suitable for analyses of proteins containing significant amounts of disordered structure. DichroIDP enables secondary structure determinations of IDPs and proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions."
315,"Proteomics and constraint-based modelling reveal enzyme kinetic properties of 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
, a model eukaryotic microalga accessible to metabolic engineering, is 17-fold smaller compared to the heterotrophic cell factory 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
. Here we generate quantitative protein abundance data of 
Chlamydomonas
 covering 2337 to 3708 proteins in various growth conditions to estimate in vivo maximum apparent turnover numbers. Using constrained-based modeling we provide proxies for in vivo turnover numbers of 568 reactions, representing a 10-fold increase over the in vitro data for 
Chlamydomonas

Chlamydomonas
 improved the accuracy of enzyme usage predictions. Our results help in extending the knowledge on uncharacterized enzymes and improve biotechnological applications of

316,"Genomic dissection of endemic carbapenem resistance reveals metallo-beta-lactamase dissemination through clonal, plasmid and integron transfer","Infections caused by metallo-beta-lactamase-producing organisms (MBLs) are a global health threat. Our understanding of transmission dynamics and how MBLs establish endemicity remains limited. We analysed two decades of 
bla
IMP-4
 evolution in a hospital using sequence data from 270 clinical and environmental isolates (including 169 completed genomes) and identified the 
bla
IMP-4
 gene across 7 Gram-negative genera, 68 bacterial strains and 7 distinct plasmid types. We showed how an initial multi-species outbreak of conserved IncC plasmids (95 genomes across 37 strains) allowed endemicity to be established through the ability of 
bla
IMP-4
 to disseminate in successful strain-genetic setting pairs we termed propagators, in particular 
Serratia marcescens
 and 
Enterobacter hormaechei
. From this reservoir, 
bla
IMP-4
 persisted through diversification of genetic settings that resulted from transfer of 
bla
IMP-4
 plasmids between bacterial hosts and of the integron carrying 
bla
IMP-4
 between plasmids. Our findings provide a framework for understanding endemicity and spread of MBLs and may have broader applicability to other carbapenemase-producing organisms."
317,spinDrop: a droplet microfluidic platform to maximise single-cell sequencing information content,"Droplet microfluidic methods have massively increased the throughput of single-cell sequencing campaigns. The benefit of scale-up is, however, accompanied by increased background noise when processing challenging samples and the overall RNA capture efficiency is lower. These drawbacks stem from the lack of strategies to enrich for high-quality material or specific cell types at the moment of cell encapsulation and the absence of implementable multi-step enzymatic processes that increase capture. Here we alleviate both bottlenecks using fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells, intact nuclei, fixed cells or target cell types and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold, while reducing background noise by up to half. We harness these properties to deliver a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development, despite starting with highly damaged input material, and provide an atlas of nascent RNA transcription during mouse organogenesis. Our method is broadly applicable to other droplet-based workflows to deliver sensitive and accurate single-cell profiling at a reduced cost."
318,Isolating salient variations of interest in single-cell data with contrastiveVI,"Single-cell datasets are routinely collected to investigate changes in cellular state between control cells and the corresponding cells in a treatment condition, such as exposure to a drug or infection by a pathogen. To better understand heterogeneity in treatment response, it is desirable to deconvolve variations enriched in treated cells from those shared with controls. However, standard computational models of single-cell data are not designed to explicitly separate these variations. Here, we introduce contrastive variational inference (contrastiveVI; 
https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI
), a framework for deconvolving variations in treatment–control single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets into shared and treatment-specific latent variables. Using three treatment–control scRNA-seq datasets, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a variety of analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering and differential expression testing. We find that contrastiveVI consistently achieves results that agree with known ground truths and often highlights subtle phenomena that may be difficult to ascertain with standard workflows. We conclude by generalizing contrastiveVI to accommodate joint transcriptome and surface protein measurements."
319,Unsupervised removal of systematic background noise from droplet-based single-cell experiments using CellBender,"Droplet-based single-cell assays, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), generate considerable background noise counts, the hallmark of which is nonzero counts in cell-free droplets and off-target gene expression in unexpected cell types. Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package CellBender. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that CellBender operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types."
320,Experimental validation of the free-energy principle with in vitro neural networks,"Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting."
321,SONAR enables cell type deconvolution with spatially weighted Poisson-Gamma model for spatial transcriptomics,"Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomic technologies have enabled the measurement of whole transcriptome profiles with preserved spatial context. However, limited by spatial resolution, the measured expressions at each spot are often from a mixture of multiple cells. Computational deconvolution methods designed for spatial transcriptomic data rarely make use of the valuable spatial information as well as the neighboring similarity information. Here, we propose SONAR, a Spatially weighted pOissoN-gAmma Regression model for cell-type deconvolution with spatial transcriptomic data. SONAR directly models the raw counts of spatial transcriptomic data and applies a geographically weighted regression framework that incorporates neighboring information to enhance local estimation of regional cell type composition. In addition, SONAR applies an additional elastic weighting step to adaptively filter dissimilar neighbors, which effectively prevents the introduction of local estimation bias in transition regions with sharp boundaries. We demonstrate the performance of SONAR over other state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data with various spatial patterns. We find that SONAR can accurately map region-specific cell types in real spatial transcriptomic data including mouse brain, human heart and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We further show that SONAR can reveal the detailed distributions and fine-grained co-localization of immune cells within the microenvironment at the tumor-normal tissue margin in human liver cancer."
322,Getting personal with epigenetics: towards individual-specific epigenomic imputation with machine learning,"Epigenetic modifications are dynamic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. Unlike the DNA sequence, epigenetic patterns vary not only between individuals, but also between different cell types within an individual. Environmental factors, somatic mutations and ageing contribute to epigenetic changes that may constitute early hallmarks or causal factors of disease. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and thus promising therapeutic targets for precision medicine. However, mapping efforts to determine an individual’s cell-type-specific epigenome are constrained by experimental costs and tissue accessibility. To address these challenges, we developed eDICE, an attention-based deep learning model that is trained to impute missing epigenomic tracks by conditioning on observed tracks. Using a recently published set of epigenomes from four individual donors, we show that transfer learning across individuals allows eDICE to successfully predict individual-specific epigenetic variation even in tissues that are unmapped in a given donor. These results highlight the potential of machine learning-based imputation methods to advance personalized epigenomics."
323,"Molecular basis of Mg
2+
 permeation through the human mitochondrial Mrs2 channel","Mitochondrial RNA splicing 2 (Mrs2), a eukaryotic CorA ortholog, enables Mg
2+
 to permeate the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in mitochondrial metabolic function. However, the mechanism by which Mrs2 permeates Mg
2+
 remains unclear. Here, we report four cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of 
Homo sapiens
 Mrs2 (hMrs2) under various conditions. All of these hMrs2 structures form symmetrical pentamers with very similar pentamer and protomer conformations. A special structural feature of Cl
−
-bound R-ring, which consists of five Arg332 residues, was found in the hMrs2 structure. Molecular dynamics simulations and mitochondrial Mg
2+
 uptake assays show that the R-ring may function as a charge repulsion barrier, and Cl
−
 may function as a ferry to jointly gate Mg
2+
 permeation in hMrs2. In addition, the membrane potential is likely to be the driving force for Mg
2+
 permeation. Our results provide insights into the channel assembly and Mg
2+
 permeation of hMrs2."
324,Multi-PGS enhances polygenic prediction by combining 937 polygenic scores,"The predictive performance of polygenic scores (PGS) is largely dependent on the number of samples available to train the PGS. Increasing the sample size for a specific phenotype is expensive and takes time, but this sample size can be effectively increased by using genetically correlated phenotypes. We propose a framework to generate multi-PGS from thousands of publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with no need to individually select the most relevant ones. In this study, the multi-PGS framework increases prediction accuracy over single PGS for all included psychiatric disorders and other available outcomes, with prediction 
R
2
 increases of up to 9-fold for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to a single PGS. We also generate multi-PGS for phenotypes without an existing GWAS and for case-case predictions. We benchmark the multi-PGS framework against other methods and highlight its potential application to new emerging biobanks."
325,Self-supervised learning with application for infant cerebellum segmentation and analysis,"Accurate tissue segmentation is critical to characterize early cerebellar development in the first two postnatal years. However, challenges in tissue segmentation arising from tightly-folded cortex, low and dynamic tissue contrast, and large inter-site data heterogeneity have limited our understanding of early cerebellar development. In this paper, we propose an accurate self-supervised learning framework for infant cerebellum segmentation. We validate its accuracy using 358 subjects from three datasets. Our results suggest the first six months exhibit the most rapid and dynamic changes, with gray matter (GM) playing a dominant role in cerebellar growth over white matter (WM). We also find both GM and WM volumes are larger in males than females, and GM and WM volumes are larger in autistic males than neurotypical males. Application of our method to a larger population will fuel more cerebellar studies, ultimately advancing our comprehension of its structure and function in neurotypical and disordered development."
326,Dictys: dynamic gene regulatory network dissects developmental continuum with single-cell multiomics,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are key determinants of cell function and identity and are dynamically rewired during development and disease. Despite decades of advancement, challenges remain in GRN inference, including dynamic rewiring, causal inference, feedback loop modeling and context specificity. To address these challenges, we develop Dictys, a dynamic GRN inference and analysis method that leverages multiomic single-cell assays of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, context-specific transcription factor footprinting, stochastic process network and efficient probabilistic modeling of single-cell RNA-sequencing read counts. Dictys improves GRN reconstruction accuracy and reproducibility and enables the inference and comparative analysis of context-specific and dynamic GRNs across developmental contexts. Dictys’ network analyses recover unique insights in human blood and mouse skin development with cell-type-specific and dynamic GRNs. Its dynamic network visualizations enable time-resolved discovery and investigation of developmental driver transcription factors and their regulated targets. Dictys is available as a free, open-source and user-friendly Python package."
327,A neural-mechanistic hybrid approach improving the predictive power of genome-scale metabolic models,"Constraint-based metabolic models have been used for decades to predict the phenotype of microorganisms in different environments. However, quantitative predictions are limited unless labor-intensive measurements of media uptake fluxes are performed. We show how hybrid neural-mechanistic models can serve as an architecture for machine learning providing a way to improve phenotype predictions. We illustrate our hybrid models with growth rate predictions of 
Escherichia coli
 and 
Pseudomonas putida
 grown in different media and with phenotype predictions of gene knocked-out 
Escherichia coli
 mutants. Our neural-mechanistic models systematically outperform constraint-based models and require training set sizes orders of magnitude smaller than classical machine learning methods. Our hybrid approach opens a doorway to enhancing constraint-based modeling: instead of constraining mechanistic models with additional experimental measurements, our hybrid models grasp the power of machine learning while fulfilling mechanistic constrains, thus saving time and resources in typical systems biology or biological engineering projects."
328,Segmenting functional tissue units across human organs using community-driven development of generalizable machine learning algorithms,"The development of a reference atlas of the healthy human body requires automated image segmentation of major anatomical structures across multiple organs based on spatial bioimages generated from various sources with differences in sample preparation. We present the setup and results of the Hacking the Human Body machine learning algorithm development competition hosted by the Human Biomolecular Atlas (HuBMAP) and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) teams on the Kaggle platform. We create a dataset containing 880 histology images with 12,901 segmented structures, engaging 1175 teams from 78 countries in community-driven, open-science development of machine learning models. Tissue variations in the dataset pose a major challenge to the teams which they overcome by using color normalization techniques and combining vision transformers with convolutional models. The best model will be productized in the HuBMAP portal to process tissue image datasets at scale in support of Human Reference Atlas construction."
329,Inference of long-range cell-cell force transmission from ECM remodeling fluctuations,"Cells sense, manipulate and respond to their mechanical microenvironment in a plethora of physiological processes, yet the understanding of how cells transmit, receive and interpret environmental cues to communicate with distant cells is severely limited due to lack of tools to quantitatively infer the complex tangle of dynamic cell-cell interactions in complicated environments. We present a computational method to systematically infer and quantify long-range cell-cell force transmission through the extracellular matrix (cell-ECM-cell communication) by correlating ECM remodeling fluctuations in between communicating cells and demonstrating that these fluctuations contain sufficient information to define unique signatures that robustly distinguish between different pairs of communicating cells. We demonstrate our method with finite element simulations and live 3D imaging of fibroblasts and cancer cells embedded in fibrin gels. While previous studies relied on the formation of a visible fibrous ‘band’ extending between cells to inform on mechanical communication, our method detected mechanical propagation even in cases where visible bands never formed. We revealed that while contractility is required, band formation is not necessary, for cell-ECM-cell communication, and that mechanical signals propagate from one cell to another even upon massive reduction in their contractility. Our method sets the stage to measure the fundamental aspects of intercellular long-range mechanical communication in physiological contexts and may provide a new functional readout for high content 3D image-based screening. The ability to infer cell-ECM-cell communication using standard confocal microscopy holds the promise for wide use and democratizing the method."
330,Extensive screening reveals previously undiscovered aminoglycoside resistance genes in human pathogens,"Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to human health, caused in part by pathogens accumulating antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through horizontal gene transfer. New ARGs are typically not recognized until they have become widely disseminated, which limits our ability to reduce their spread. In this study, we use large-scale computational screening of bacterial genomes to identify previously undiscovered mobile ARGs in pathogens. From ~1 million genomes, we predict 1,071,815 genes encoding 34,053 unique aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs). These cluster into 7,612 families (<70% amino acid identity) of which 88 are previously described. Fifty new AME families are associated with mobile genetic elements and pathogenic hosts. From these, 24 of 28 experimentally tested AMEs confer resistance to aminoglycoside(s) in 
Escherichia coli
, with 17 providing resistance above clinical breakpoints. This study greatly expands the range of clinically relevant aminoglycoside resistance determinants and demonstrates that computational methods enable early discovery of potentially emerging ARGs."
331,Functional annotation of proteins for signaling network inference in non-model species,"Molecular biology aims to understand cellular responses and regulatory dynamics in complex biological systems. However, these studies remain challenging in non-model species due to poor functional annotation of regulatory proteins. To overcome this limitation, we develop a multi-layer neural network that determines protein functionality directly from the protein sequence. We annotate kinases and phosphatases in 
Glycine max
. We use the functional annotations from our neural network, Bayesian inference principles, and high resolution phosphoproteomics to infer phosphorylation signaling cascades in soybean exposed to cold, and identify Glyma.10G173000 (TOI5) and Glyma.19G007300 (TOT3) as key temperature regulators. Importantly, the signaling cascade inference does not rely upon known kinase motifs or interaction data, enabling de novo identification of kinase-substrate interactions. Conclusively, our neural network shows generalization and scalability, as such we extend our predictions to 
Oryza sativa
, 
Zea mays
, 
Sorghum bicolor
, and 
Triticum aestivum
. Taken together, we develop a signaling inference approach for non-model species leveraging our predicted kinases and phosphatases."
332,Network-wide thermodynamic constraints shape NAD(P)H cofactor specificity of biochemical reactions,"The ubiquitous coexistence of the redox cofactors NADH and NADPH is widely considered to facilitate an efficient operation of cellular redox metabolism. However, it remains unclear what shapes the NAD(P)H specificity of specific redox reactions. Here, we present a computational framework to analyze the effect of redox cofactor swaps on the maximal thermodynamic potential of a metabolic network and use it to investigate key aspects of redox cofactor redundancy in 
Escherichia coli
. As one major result, our analysis suggests that evolved NAD(P)H specificities are largely shaped by metabolic network structure and associated thermodynamic constraints enabling thermodynamic driving forces that are close or even identical to the theoretical optimum and significantly higher compared to random specificities. Furthermore, while redundancy of NAD(P)H is clearly beneficial for thermodynamic driving forces, a third redox cofactor would require a low standard redox potential to be advantageous. Our approach also predicts trends of redox-cofactor concentration ratios and could facilitate the design of optimal redox cofactor specificities."
333,Direct inference and control of genetic population structure from RNA sequencing data,"RNAseq data can be used to infer genetic variants, yet its use for estimating genetic population structure remains underexplored. Here, we construct a freely available computational tool (RGStraP) to estimate RNAseq-based genetic principal components (RG-PCs) and assess whether RG-PCs can be used to control for population structure in gene expression analyses. Using whole blood samples from understudied Nepalese populations and the Geuvadis study, we show that RG-PCs had comparable results to paired array-based genotypes, with high genotype concordance and high correlations of genetic principal components, capturing subpopulations within the dataset. In differential gene expression analysis, we found that inclusion of RG-PCs as covariates reduced test statistic inflation. Our paper demonstrates that genetic population structure can be directly inferred and controlled for using RNAseq data, thus facilitating improved retrospective and future analyses of transcriptomic data."
334,Integrative analysis of transcriptome dynamics during human craniofacial development identifies candidate disease genes,"Craniofacial disorders arise in early pregnancy and are one of the most common congenital defects. To fully understand how craniofacial disorders arise, it is essential to characterize gene expression during the patterning of the craniofacial region. To address this, we performed bulk and single-cell RNA-seq on human craniofacial tissue from 4-8 weeks post conception. Comparisons to dozens of other human tissues revealed 239 genes most strongly expressed during craniofacial development. Craniofacial-biased developmental enhancers were enriched +/− 400 kb surrounding these craniofacial-biased genes. Gene co-expression analysis revealed that regulatory hubs are enriched for known disease causing genes and are resistant to mutation in the normal healthy population. Combining transcriptomic and epigenomic data we identified 539 genes likely to contribute to craniofacial disorders. While most have not been previously implicated in craniofacial disorders, we demonstrate this set of genes has increased levels of de novo mutations in orofacial clefting patients warranting further study."
335,A multiplexed bacterial two-hybrid for rapid characterization of protein–protein interactions and iterative protein design,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for biological functions and have applications ranging from drug design to synthetic cell circuits. Coiled-coils have been used as a model to study the sequence determinants of specificity. However, building well-behaved sets of orthogonal pairs of coiled-coils remains challenging due to inaccurate predictions of orthogonality and difficulties in testing at scale. To address this, we develop the next-generation bacterial two-hybrid (NGB2H) method, which allows for the rapid exploration of interactions of programmed protein libraries in a quantitative and scalable way using next-generation sequencing readout. We design, build, and test large sets of orthogonal synthetic coiled-coils, assayed over 8,000 PPIs, and used the dataset to train a more accurate coiled-coil scoring algorithm (iCipa). After characterizing nearly 18,000 new PPIs, we identify to the best of our knowledge the largest set of orthogonal coiled-coils to date, with fifteen on-target interactions. Our approach provides a powerful tool for the design of orthogonal PPIs."
336,Robust phenotyping of highly multiplexed tissue imaging data using pixel-level clustering,"While technologies for multiplexed imaging have provided an unprecedented understanding of tissue composition in health and disease, interpreting this data remains a significant computational challenge. To understand the spatial organization of tissue and how it relates to disease processes, imaging studies typically focus on cell-level phenotypes. However, images can capture biologically important objects that are outside of cells, such as the extracellular matrix. Here, we describe a pipeline, Pixie, that achieves robust and quantitative annotation of pixel-level features using unsupervised clustering and show its application across a variety of biological contexts and multiplexed imaging platforms. Furthermore, current cell phenotyping strategies that rely on unsupervised clustering can be labor intensive and require large amounts of manual cluster adjustments. We demonstrate how pixel clusters that lie within cells can be used to improve cell annotations. We comprehensively evaluate pre-processing steps and parameter choices to optimize clustering performance and quantify the reproducibility of our method. Importantly, Pixie is open source and easily customizable through a user-friendly interface."
337,Three-dimensional molecular architecture of mouse organogenesis,"Mammalian embryos exhibit sophisticated cellular patterning that is intricately orchestrated at both molecular and cellular level. It has recently become apparent that cells within the animal body display significant heterogeneity, both in terms of their cellular properties and spatial distributions. However, current spatial transcriptomic profiling either lacks three-dimensional representation or is limited in its ability to capture the complexity of embryonic tissues and organs. Here, we present a spatial transcriptomic atlas of all major organs at embryonic day 13.5 in the mouse embryo, and provide a three-dimensional rendering of molecular regulation for embryonic patterning with stacked sections. By integrating the spatial atlas with corresponding single-cell transcriptomic data, we offer a detailed molecular annotation of the dynamic nature of organ development, spatial cellular interactions, embryonic axes, and divergence of cell fates that underlie mammalian development, which would pave the way for precise organ engineering and stem cell-based regenerative medicine."
338,Guided construction of single cell reference for human and mouse lung,"Accurate cell type identification is a key and rate-limiting step in single-cell data analysis. Single-cell references with comprehensive cell types, reproducible and functionally validated cell identities, and common nomenclatures are much needed by the research community for automated cell type annotation, data integration, and data sharing. Here, we develop a computational pipeline utilizing the LungMAP CellCards as a dictionary to consolidate single-cell transcriptomic datasets of 104 human lungs and 17 mouse lung samples to construct LungMAP single-cell reference (CellRef) for both normal human and mouse lungs. CellRefs define 48 human and 40 mouse lung cell types catalogued from diverse anatomic locations and developmental time points. We demonstrate the accuracy and stability of LungMAP CellRefs and their utility for automated cell type annotation of both normal and diseased lungs using multiple independent methods and testing data. We develop user-friendly web interfaces for easy access and maximal utilization of the LungMAP CellRefs."
339,"Rif1 restrains the rate of replication origin firing in 
Xenopus laevis","Metazoan genomes are duplicated by the coordinated activation of clusters of replication origins at different times during S phase, but the underlying mechanisms of this temporal program remain unclear during early development. Rif1, a key replication timing factor, inhibits origin firing by recruiting protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to chromatin counteracting S phase kinases. We have previously described that Rif1 depletion accelerates early 
Xenopus laevis
 embryonic cell cycles. Here, we find that in the absence of Rif1, patterns of replication foci change along with the acceleration of replication cluster activation. However, initiations increase only moderately inside active clusters. Our numerical simulations suggest that the absence of Rif1 compresses the temporal program towards more homogeneity and increases the availability of limiting initiation factors. We experimentally demonstrate that Rif1 depletion increases the chromatin-binding of the S phase kinase Cdc7/Drf1, the firing factors Treslin, MTBP, Cdc45, RecQL4, and the phosphorylation of both Treslin and MTBP. We show that Rif1 globally, but not locally, restrains the replication program in early embryos, possibly by inhibiting or excluding replication factors from chromatin."
340,Preventing antimalarial drug resistance with triple artemisinin-based combination therapies,"Increasing levels of artemisinin and partner drug resistance threaten malaria control and elimination globally. Triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs) which combine artemisinin derivatives with two partner drugs are efficacious and well tolerated in clinical trials, including in areas of multidrug-resistant malaria. Whether early TACT adoption could delay the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance is a question of vital importance. Using two independent individual-based models of 
Plasmodium falciparum
 epidemiology and evolution, we evaluated whether introduction of either artesunate-mefloquine-piperaquine or artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine resulted in lower long-term artemisinin-resistance levels and treatment failure rates compared with continued ACT use. We show that introduction of TACTs could significantly delay the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance and treatment failure, extending the useful therapeutic life of current antimalarial drugs, and improving the chances of malaria elimination. We conclude that immediate introduction of TACTs should be considered by policy makers in areas of emerging artemisinin resistance."
341,Partition complex structure can arise from sliding and bridging of ParB dimers,"In many bacteria, chromosome segregation requires the association of ParB to the 
parS
-containing centromeric region to form the partition complex. However, the structure and formation of this complex have been unclear. Recently, studies have revealed that CTP binding enables ParB dimers to slide along DNA and condense the centromeric region through the formation of DNA bridges. Using semi-flexible polymer simulations, we demonstrate that these properties can explain partition complex formation. Transient ParB bridges organize DNA into globular states or hairpins and helical structures, depending on bridge lifetime, while separate simulations show that ParB sliding reproduces the multi-peaked binding profile observed in 
Caulobacter crescentus
. Combining sliding and bridging into a unified model, we find that short-lived ParB bridges do not impede sliding and can reproduce both the binding profile and condensation of the nucleoprotein complex. Overall, our model elucidates the mechanism of partition complex formation and predicts its fine structure."
342,Macrocyclization of linear molecules by deep learning to facilitate macrocyclic drug candidates discovery,"Interest in macrocycles as potential therapeutic agents has increased rapidly. Macrocyclization of bioactive acyclic molecules provides a potential avenue to yield novel chemical scaffolds, which can contribute to the improvement of the biological activity and physicochemical properties of these molecules. In this study, we propose a computational macrocyclization method based on Transformer architecture (which we name Macformer). Leveraging deep learning, Macformer explores the vast chemical space of macrocyclic analogues of a given acyclic molecule by adding diverse linkers compatible with the acyclic molecule. Macformer can efficiently learn the implicit relationships between acyclic and macrocyclic structures represented as SMILES strings and generate plenty of macrocycles with chemical diversity and structural novelty. In data augmentation scenarios using both internal ChEMBL and external ZINC test datasets, Macformer display excellent performance and generalisability. We showcase the utility of Macformer when combined with molecular docking simulations and wet lab based experimental validation, by applying it to the prospective design of macrocyclic JAK2 inhibitors."
343,Subunit gating resulting from individual protonation events in Kir2 channels,"Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels open at the ‘helix bundle crossing’ (HBC), formed by the M2 helices at the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane pore. Introduced negative charges at the HBC (G178D) in Kir2.2 channels forces opening, allowing pore wetting and free movement of permeant ions between the cytoplasm and the inner cavity. Single-channel recordings reveal striking, pH-dependent, subconductance behaviors in G178D (or G178E and equivalent Kir2.1[G177E]) mutant channels, with well-resolved non-cooperative subconductance levels. Decreasing cytoplasmic pH shifts the probability towards lower conductance levels. Molecular dynamics simulations show how protonation of Kir2.2[G178D], or the D173 pore-lining residues, changes solvation, K
+
 ion occupancy, and K
+
 conductance. Ion channel gating and conductance are classically understood as separate processes. The present data reveal how individual protonation events change the electrostatic microenvironment of the pore, resulting in step-wise alterations of ion pooling, and hence conductance, that appear as ‘gated’ substates."
344,"CheckM2: a rapid, scalable and accurate tool for assessing microbial genome quality using machine learning","Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools have dramatically increased the recovery rate of microbial genomes from metagenomic data. Assessing the quality of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) is a critical step before downstream analysis. Here, we present CheckM2, an improved method of predicting genome quality of MAGs using machine learning. Using synthetic and experimental data, we demonstrate that CheckM2 outperforms existing tools in both accuracy and computational speed. In addition, CheckM2’s database can be rapidly updated with new high-quality reference genomes, including taxa represented only by a single genome. We also show that CheckM2 accurately predicts genome quality for MAGs from novel lineages, even for those with reduced genome size (for example, Patescibacteria and the DPANN superphylum). CheckM2 provides accurate genome quality predictions across bacterial and archaeal lineages, giving increased confidence when inferring biological conclusions from MAGs."
345,Segmentation metric misinterpretations in bioimage analysis,"Quantitative evaluation of image segmentation algorithms is crucial in the field of bioimage analysis. The most common assessment scores, however, are often misinterpreted and multiple definitions coexist with the same name. Here we present the ambiguities of evaluation metrics for segmentation algorithms and show how these misinterpretations can alter leaderboards of influential competitions. We also propose guidelines for how the currently existing problems could be tackled."
346,Deep immunophenotyping reveals clinically distinct cellular states and ecosystems in large-scale colorectal cancer,"Determining the diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and their organization into cellular communities, is critical for understanding the biological heterogeneity and therapy of cancer. Here, we deeply immunophenotype the colorectal cancer (CRC) by integrative analysis of large-scale bulk and single cell transcriptome of 2350 patients and 53,137 cells. A rich landscape of 42 cellular states and 7 ecosystems in TMEs is uncovered and extend the previous immune classifications of CRC. Functional pathways and potential transcriptional regulators analysis of cellular states and ecosystems reveal cancer hallmark-related pathways and several critical transcription factors in CRC. High-resolution characterization of the TMEs, we discover the potential utility of cellular states (i.e., Monocytes/Macrophages and CD8 T cell) and ecosystems for prognosis and clinical therapy selection of CRC. Together, our results expand our understanding of cellular organization in TMEs of CRC, with potential implications for the development of biomarkers and precision therapies."
347,MSBooster: improving peptide identification rates using deep learning-based features,"Peptide identification in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments relies on computational algorithms for matching acquired MS/MS spectra against sequences of candidate peptides using database search tools, such as MSFragger. Here, we present a new tool, MSBooster, for rescoring peptide-to-spectrum matches using additional features incorporating deep learning-based predictions of peptide properties, such as LC retention time, ion mobility, and MS/MS spectra. We demonstrate the utility of MSBooster, in tandem with MSFragger and Percolator, in several different workflows, including nonspecific searches (immunopeptidomics), direct identification of peptides from data independent acquisition data, single-cell proteomics, and data generated on an ion mobility separation-enabled timsTOF MS platform. MSBooster is fast, robust, and fully integrated into the widely used FragPipe computational platform."
348,DBlink: dynamic localization microscopy in super spatiotemporal resolution via deep learning,"Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized biological imaging, improving the spatial resolution of traditional microscopes by an order of magnitude. However, SMLM techniques require long acquisition times, typically a few minutes, to yield a single super-resolved image, because they depend on accumulation of many localizations over thousands of recorded frames. Hence, the capability of SMLM to observe dynamics at high temporal resolution has always been limited. In this work, we present DBlink, a deep-learning-based method for super spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction from SMLM data. The input to DBlink is a recorded video of SMLM data and the output is a super spatiotemporal resolution video reconstruction. We use a convolutional neural network combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory network architecture, designed for capturing long-term dependencies between different input frames. We demonstrate DBlink performance on simulated filaments and mitochondria-like structures, on experimental SMLM data under controlled motion conditions and on live-cell dynamic SMLM. DBlink’s spatiotemporal interpolation constitutes an important advance in super-resolution imaging of dynamic processes in live cells."
349,Cellular state landscape and herpes simplex virus type 1 infection progression are connected,"Prediction, prevention and treatment of virus infections require understanding of cell-to-cell variability that leads to heterogenous disease outcomes, but the source of this heterogeneity has yet to be clarified. To study the multimodal response of single human cells to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, we mapped high-dimensional viral and cellular state spaces throughout the infection using multiplexed imaging and quantitative single-cell measurements of viral and cellular mRNAs and proteins. Here we show that the high-dimensional cellular state scape can predict heterogenous infections, and cells move through the cellular state landscape according to infection progression. Spatial information reveals that infection changes the cellular state of both infected cells and of their neighbors. The multiplexed imaging of HSV-1-induced cellular modifications links infection progression to changes in signaling responses, transcriptional activity, and processing bodies. Our data show that multiplexed quantification of responses at the single-cell level, across thousands of cells helps predict infections and identify new targets for antivirals."
350,Virtual alignment of pathology image series for multi-gigapixel whole slide images,"Interest in spatial omics is on the rise, but generation of highly multiplexed images remains challenging, due to cost, expertise, methodical constraints, and access to technology. An alternative approach is to register collections of whole slide images (WSI), generating spatially aligned datasets. WSI registration is a two-part problem, the first being the alignment itself and the second the application of transformations to huge multi-gigapixel images. To address both challenges, we developed Virtual Alignment of pathoLogy Image Series (VALIS), software which enables generation of highly multiplexed images by aligning any number of brightfield and/or immunofluorescent WSI, the results of which can be saved in the ome.tiff format. Benchmarking using publicly available datasets indicates VALIS provides state-of-the-art accuracy in WSI registration and 3D reconstruction. Leveraging existing open-source software tools, VALIS is written in Python, providing a free, fast, scalable, robust, and easy-to-use pipeline for registering multi-gigapixel WSI, facilitating downstream spatial analyses."
351,Evolutionary modeling suggests that addictions may be driven by competition-induced microbiome dysbiosis,"Recent studies revealed mechanisms by which the microbiome affects its host’s brain, behavior and wellbeing, and that dysbiosis – persistent microbiome-imbalance – is associated with the onset and progress of various chronic diseases, including addictive behaviors. Yet, understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape the host-microbiome ecosystem and affect the host state, is still limited. Here we propose that competition dynamics within the microbiome, associated with host-microbiome mutual regulation, may promote dysbiosis and aggravate addictive behaviors. We construct a mathematical framework, modeling the dynamics of the host-microbiome ecosystem in response to alterations. We find that when this ecosystem is exposed to substantial perturbations, the microbiome may shift towards a composition that reinforces the new host state. Such a positive feedback loop augments post-perturbation imbalances, hindering attempts to return to the initial equilibrium, promoting relapse episodes and prolonging addictions. We show that the initial microbiome composition is a key factor: a diverse microbiome enhances the ecosystem’s resilience, whereas lower microbiome diversity is more prone to lead to dysbiosis, exacerbating addictions. This framework provides evolutionary and ecological perspectives on host-microbiome interactions and their implications for host behavior and health, while offering verifiable predictions with potential relevance to clinical treatments."
352,VBASS enables integration of single cell gene expression data in Bayesian association analysis of rare variants,"Rare or de novo variants have substantial contribution to human diseases, but the statistical power to identify risk genes by rare variants is generally low due to rarity of genotype data. Previous studies have shown that risk genes usually have high expression in relevant cell types, although for many conditions the identity of these cell types are largely unknown. Recent efforts in single cell atlas in human and model organisms produced large amount of gene expression data. Here we present VBASS, a Bayesian method that integrates single-cell expression and de novo variant (DNV) data to improve power of disease risk gene discovery. VBASS models disease risk prior as a function of expression profiles, approximated by deep neural networks. It learns the weights of neural networks and parameters of Gamma-Poisson likelihood models of DNV counts jointly from expression and genetics data. On simulated data, VBASS shows proper error rate control and better power than state-of-the-art methods. We applied VBASS to published datasets and identified more candidate risk genes with supports from literature or data from independent cohorts. VBASS can be generalized to integrate other types of functional genomics data in statistical genetics analysis."
353,Obligate endosymbiosis enables genome expansion during eukaryogenesis,"The endosymbiosis of an alpha-proteobacterium that gave rise to mitochondria was one of the key events in eukaryogenesis. One striking outcome of eukaryogenesis was a much more complex cell with a large genome. Despite the existence of many alternative hypotheses for this and other patterns potentially related to endosymbiosis, a constructive evolutionary model in which these hypotheses can be studied is still lacking. Here, we present a theoretical approach in which we focus on the consequences rather than the causes of mitochondrial endosymbiosis. Using a constructive evolutionary model of cell-cycle regulation, we find that genome expansion and genome size asymmetry arise from emergent host–symbiont cell-cycle coordination. We also find that holobionts with large host and small symbiont genomes perform best on long timescales and mimic the outcome of eukaryogenesis. By designing and studying a constructive evolutionary model of obligate endosymbiosis, we uncovered some of the forces that may drive the patterns observed in nature. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for patterns related to mitochondrial endosymbiosis, such as genome size asymmetry, and reveal evolutionary outcomes that have not been considered so far, such as cell-cycle coordination without direct communication."
354,Multi-omic analysis reveals dynamic changes of three-dimensional chromatin architecture during T cell differentiation,"Cell differentiation results in widespread changes in transcriptional programs as well as multi-level remodeling of three-dimensional genome architecture. Nonetheless, few synthetically investigate the chromatin higher-order landscapes in different T helper (Th) cells. Using RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and Hi-C assays, we characterize dynamic changes in chromatin organization at different levels during Naive CD4
+
 T cells differentiation into T helper 17 (Th17) and T helper 1 (Th1) cells. Upon differentiation, we observe decreased short-range and increased extra-long-range chromatin interactions. Although there is no apparent global switch in the A/B compartments, Th cells display the weaker compartmentalization. A portion of topologically associated domains are rearranged. Furthermore, we identify cell-type specific enhancer-promoter loops, many of which are associated with functional genes in Th cells, such as 
Rorc
 facilitating Th17 differentiation and 
Hif1a
 responding to intracellular oxygen levels in Th1. Taken together, these results uncover the general patterns of chromatin reorganization and epigenetic landscapes of gene regulation during T helper cell differentiation."
355,Lifespan-extending interventions induce consistent patterns of fatty acid oxidation in mouse livers,"Aging manifests as progressive deteriorations in homeostasis, requiring systems-level perspectives to investigate the gradual molecular dysregulation of underlying biological processes. Here, we report systemic changes in the molecular regulation of biological processes under multiple lifespan-extending interventions. Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC) analyses of mouse liver proteomics and transcriptomics data show that mechanistically distinct lifespan-extending interventions (acarbose, 17α-estradiol, rapamycin, and calorie restriction) generally tighten the regulation of biological modules. These tightening patterns are similar across the interventions, particularly in processes such as fatty acid oxidation, immune response, and stress response. Differences in DIRAC patterns between proteins and transcripts highlight specific modules which may be tightened via augmented cap-independent translation. Moreover, the systemic shifts in fatty acid metabolism are supported through integrated analysis of liver transcriptomics data with a mouse genome-scale metabolic model. Our findings highlight the power of systems-level approaches for identifying and characterizing the biological processes involved in aging and longevity."
356,Comprehensive analysis of intercellular communication in the thermogenic adipose niche,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for regulating body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis. The ability of thermogenic adipocytes to dissipate chemical energy as heat counteracts weight gain and has gained considerable attention as a strategy against obesity. BAT undergoes major remodeling in a cold environment. This remodeling results from changes in the number and function of brown adipocytes, expanding the network of blood vessels and sympathetic nerves, and changes in the composition and function of immune cells. Such synergistic adaptation requires extensive crosstalk between individual cells in the tissue to coordinate their responses. To understand the mechanisms of intercellular communication in BAT, we apply the CellChat algorithm to single-cell transcriptomic data of mouse BAT. We construct an integrative network of the ligand-receptor interactome in BAT and identify the major signaling inputs and outputs of each cell type. By comparing the ligand-receptor interactions in BAT of mice housed at different environmental temperatures, we show that cold exposure enhances the intercellular interactions among the major cell types in BAT, including adipocytes, adipocyte progenitors, lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells, myelinated and non-myelinated Schwann cells, and immune cells. These interactions are predicted to regulate the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and neurite growth. Together, our integrative analysis of intercellular communications in BAT and their dynamic regulation in response to housing temperatures provides a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying BAT thermogenesis. The resources presented in this study offer a valuable platform for future investigations of BAT development and thermogenesis."
357,Single-cell sequencing reveals the landscape of the human brain metastatic microenvironment,"Brain metastases is the most common intracranial tumor and account for approximately 20% of all systematic cancer cases. It is a leading cause of death in advanced-stage cancer, resulting in a five-year overall survival rate below 10%. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify effective biomarkers that can support frequent surveillance and promote efficient drug guidance in brain metastasis. Recently, the remarkable breakthroughs in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have advanced our insights into the tumor microenvironment (TME) at single-cell resolution, which offers the potential to unravel the metastasis-related cellular crosstalk and provides the potential for improving therapeutic effects mediated by multifaceted cellular interactions within TME. In this study, we have applied scRNA-seq and profiled 10,896 cells collected from five brain tumor tissue samples originating from breast and lung cancers. Our analysis reveals the presence of various intratumoral components, including tumor cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, stromal cells expressing neural stem cell markers, as well as minor populations of oligodendrocytes and T cells. Interestingly, distinct cellular compositions are observed across different samples, indicating the influence of diverse cellular interactions on the infiltration patterns within the TME. Importantly, we identify tumor-associated fibroblasts in both our in-house dataset and external scRNA-seq datasets. These fibroblasts exhibit high expression of type I collagen genes, dominate cell-cell interactions within the TME via the type I collagen signaling axis, and facilitate the remodeling of the TME to a collagen-I-rich extracellular matrix similar to the original TME at primary sites. Additionally, we observe M1 activation in native microglial cells and infiltrated macrophages, which may contribute to a proinflammatory TME and the upregulation of collagen type I expression in fibroblasts. Furthermore, tumor cell-specific receptors exhibit a significant association with patient survival in both brain metastasis and native glioblastoma cases. Taken together, our comprehensive analyses identify type I collagen-secreting tumor-associated fibroblasts as key mediators in metastatic brain tumors and uncover tumor receptors that are potentially associated with patient survival. These discoveries provide potential biomarkers for effective therapeutic targets and intervention strategies."
358,Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling of acute myeloid leukemia reveals heterogeneous lineage composition upon therapy-resistance,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by high rate of therapy resistance. Since the cell of origin can impact response to therapy, it is crucial to understand the lineage composition of AML cells at time of therapy resistance. Here we leverage single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling of 22 AML bone marrow aspirates from eight patients at time of therapy resistance and following subsequent therapy to characterize their lineage landscape. Our findings reveal a complex lineage architecture of therapy-resistant AML cells that are primed for stem and progenitor lineages and spanning quiescent, activated and late stem cell/progenitor states. Remarkably, therapy-resistant AML cells are also composed of cells primed for differentiated myeloid, erythroid and even lymphoid lineages. The heterogeneous lineage composition persists following subsequent therapy, with early progenitor-driven features marking unfavorable prognosis in The Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort. Pseudotime analysis further confirms the vast degree of heterogeneity driven by the dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility. Our findings suggest that therapy-resistant AML cells are characterized not only by stem and progenitor states, but also by a continuum of differentiated cellular lineages. The heterogeneity in lineages likely contributes to their therapy resistance by harboring different degrees of lineage-specific susceptibilities to therapy."
359,Increased interregional virus exchange and nucleotide diversity outline the expansion of chikungunya virus in Brazil,"The emergence and reemergence of mosquito-borne diseases in Brazil such as yellow fever, zika, chikungunya, and dengue have had serious impacts on public health. Concerns have been raised due to the rapid dissemination of the chikungunya virus across the country since its first detection in 2014 in Northeast Brazil. In this work, we carried out on-site training activities in genomic surveillance in partnership with the National Network of Public Health Laboratories that have led to the generation of 422 chikungunya virus genomes from 12 Brazilian states over the past two years (2021–2022), a period that has seen more than 312 thousand chikungunya fever cases reported in the country. These genomes increased the amount of available data and allowed a more comprehensive characterization of the dispersal dynamics of the chikungunya virus East-Central-South-African lineage in Brazil. Tree branching patterns revealed the emergence and expansion of two distinct subclades. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the northeast region has been the leading hub of virus spread towards other regions. Increased frequency of C > T transitions among the new genomes suggested that host restriction factors from the immune system such as ADAR and AID/APOBEC deaminases might be driving the genetic diversity of the chikungunya virus in Brazil."
360,Identification of transcriptional programs using dense vector representations defined by mutual information with GeneVector,"Deciphering individual cell phenotypes from cell-specific transcriptional processes requires high dimensional single cell RNA sequencing. However, current dimensionality reduction methods aggregate sparse gene information across cells, without directly measuring the relationships that exist between genes. By performing dimensionality reduction with respect to gene co-expression, low-dimensional features can model these gene-specific relationships and leverage shared signal to overcome sparsity. We describe GeneVector, a scalable framework for dimensionality reduction implemented as a vector space model using mutual information between gene expression. Unlike other methods, including principal component analysis and variational autoencoders, GeneVector uses latent space arithmetic in a lower dimensional gene embedding to identify transcriptional programs and classify cell types. In this work, we show in four single cell RNA-seq datasets that GeneVector was able to capture phenotype-specific pathways, perform batch effect correction, interactively annotate cell types, and identify pathway variation with treatment over time."
361,Multi-omics analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells shows cell aging that alters immunomodulatory activity through the downregulation of PD-L1,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess potent immunomodulatory activity and have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic potential in treating inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive function of MSCs are not fully understood, hindering the development of standardized MSC-based therapies for clinical use. In this study, we profile the single-cell transcriptomes of MSCs isolated from adipose tissue (AD), bone marrow (BM), placental chorionic membrane (PM), and umbilical cord (UC). Our results demonstrate that MSCs undergo a progressive aging process and that the cellular senescence state influences their immunosuppressive activity by downregulating PD-L1 expression. Through integrated analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data, we identify GATA2 as a regulator of MSC senescence and PD-L1 expression. Overall, our findings highlight the roles of cell aging and PD-L1 expression in modulating the immunosuppressive efficacy of MSCs and implicating perinatal MSC therapy for clinical applications in inflammatory disorders."
362,"Genome-scale metabolic modeling of 
Aspergillus fumigatus
 strains reveals growth dependencies on the lung microbiome","Aspergillus fumigatus
, an opportunistic human pathogen, frequently infects the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and is one of the most common causes of infectious-disease death in immunocompromised patients. Here, we construct 252 strain-specific, genome-scale metabolic models of this important fungal pathogen to study and better understand the metabolic component of its pathogenic versatility. The models show that 23.1% of 
A. fumigatus
 metabolic reactions are not conserved across strains and are mainly associated with amino acid, nucleotide, and nitrogen metabolism. Profiles of non-conserved reactions and growth-supporting reaction fluxes are sufficient to differentiate strains, for example by environmental or clinical origin. In addition, shotgun metagenomics analysis of sputum from 40 cystic fibrosis patients (15 females, 25 males) before and after diagnosis with an 
A. fumigatus
 colonization suggests that the fungus shapes the lung microbiome towards a more beneficial fungal growth environment associated with aromatic amino acid availability and the shikimate pathway. Our findings are starting points for the development of drugs or microbiome intervention strategies targeting fungal metabolic needs for survival and colonization in the non-native environment of the human lung."
363,Identifying and profiling structural similarities between Spike of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral or host proteins with Machaon,"Using protein structure to predict function, interactions, and evolutionary history is still an open challenge, with existing approaches relying extensively on protein homology and families. Here, we present Machaon, a data-driven method combining orientation invariant metrics on phi-psi angles, inter-residue contacts and surface complexity. It can be readily applied on whole structures or segments—such as domains and binding sites. Machaon was applied on SARS-CoV-2 Spike monomers of native, Delta and Omicron variants and identified correlations with a wide range of viral proteins from close to distant taxonomy ranks, as well as host proteins, such as ACE2 receptor. Machaon’s meta-analysis of the results highlights structural, chemical and transcriptional similarities between the Spike monomer and human proteins, indicating a multi-level viral mimicry. This extended analysis also revealed relationships of the Spike protein with biological processes such as ubiquitination and angiogenesis and highlighted different patterns in virus attachment among the studied variants.

364,Fast detection of slender bodies in high density microscopy data,"Computer-aided analysis of biological microscopy data has seen a massive improvement with the utilization of general-purpose deep learning techniques. Yet, in microscopy studies of multi-organism systems, the problem of collision and overlap remains challenging. This is particularly true for systems composed of slender bodies such as swimming nematodes, swimming spermatozoa, or the beating of eukaryotic or prokaryotic flagella. Here, we develop a end-to-end deep learning approach to extract precise shape trajectories of generally motile and overlapping slender bodies. Our method works in low resolution settings where feature keypoints are hard to define and detect. Detection is fast and we demonstrate the ability to track thousands of overlapping organisms simultaneously. While our approach is agnostic to area of application, we present it in the setting of and exemplify its usability on dense experiments of swimming 
Caenorhabditis elegans
. The model training is achieved purely on synthetic data, utilizing a physics-based model for nematode motility, and we demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize from simulations to experimental videos."
365,Segmentation of human functional tissue units in support of a Human Reference Atlas,"The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) aims to compile a Human Reference Atlas (HRA) for the healthy adult body at the cellular level. Functional tissue units (FTUs), relevant for HRA construction, are of pathobiological significance. Manual segmentation of FTUs does not scale; highly accurate and performant, open-source machine-learning algorithms are needed. We designed and hosted a Kaggle competition that focused on development of such algorithms and 1200 teams from 60 countries participated. We present the competition outcomes and an expanded analysis of the winning algorithms on additional kidney and colon tissue data, and conduct a pilot study to understand spatial location and density of FTUs across the kidney. The top algorithm from the competition, Tom, outperforms other algorithms in the expanded study, while using fewer computational resources. Tom was added to the HuBMAP infrastructure to run kidney FTU segmentation at scale—showcasing the value of Kaggle competitions for advancing research."
366,Parvalbumin neurons enhance temporal coding and reduce cortical noise in complex auditory scenes,"Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. Parvalbumin neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex of mice using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect parvalbumin neurons’ contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing parvalbumin neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, and over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that parvalbumin neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes."

Comparing the 3D reconstructed cellular data with the 2D data, we show significantly shorter distances between immune cells and vascular endothelial cells (56 µm in 3D 
vs
 108 µm in 2D). We also show 10–70% more T cells (total) within 30 µm of a neighboring T helper cell in 3D

MATRICS-A provides a framework for analysis of 3D spatial cell relationships in healthy and aging organs and could be further extended to diseased organs."
368,Mutations observed in somatic evolution reveal underlying gene mechanisms,"Highly sensitive DNA sequencing techniques have allowed the discovery of large numbers of somatic mutations in normal tissues. Some mutations confer a competitive advantage over wild-type cells, generating expanding clones that spread through the tissue. Competition between mutant clones leads to selection. This process can be considered a large scale, in vivo screen for mutations increasing cell fitness. It follows that somatic missense mutations may offer new insights into the relationship between protein structure, function and cell fitness. We present a flexible statistical method for exploring the selection of structural features in data sets of somatic mutants. We show how this approach can evidence selection of specific structural features in key drivers in aged tissues. Finally, we show how drivers may be classified as fitness-enhancing and fitness-suppressing through different patterns of mutation enrichment. This method offers a route to understanding the mechanism of protein function through in vivo mutant selection."
369,GPCRome-wide analysis of G-protein-coupling diversity using a computational biology approach,"GPCRs are master regulators of cell signaling by transducing extracellular stimuli into the cell via selective coupling to intracellular G-proteins. Here we present a computational analysis of the structural determinants of G-protein-coupling repertoire of experimental and predicted 3D GPCR-G-protein complexes. Interface contact analysis recapitulates structural hallmarks associated with G-protein-coupling specificity, including TM5, TM6 and ICLs. We employ interface contacts as fingerprints to cluster G

370,Nutritional redundancy in the human diet and its application in phenotype association studies,"Studying human dietary intake may help us identify effective measures to treat or prevent many chronic diseases whose natural histories are influenced by nutritional factors. Here, by examining five cohorts with dietary intake data collected on different time scales, we show that the food intake profile varies substantially across individuals and over time, while the nutritional intake profile appears fairly stable. We refer to this phenomenon as ‘nutritional redundancy’ and attribute it to the nested structure of the food-nutrient network. This network enables us to quantify the level of nutritional redundancy for each diet assessment of any individual. Interestingly, this nutritional redundancy measure does not strongly correlate with any classical healthy diet scores, but its performance in predicting healthy aging shows comparable strength. Moreover, after adjusting for age, we find that a high nutritional redundancy is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes."
371,Detecting shortcut learning for fair medical AI using shortcut testing,"Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for improving healthcare, but it is critical to ensure that its use will not propagate or amplify health disparities. An important step is to characterize the (un)fairness of ML models—their tendency to perform differently across subgroups of the population—and to understand its underlying mechanisms. One potential driver of algorithmic unfairness, shortcut learning, arises when ML models base predictions on improper correlations in the training data. Diagnosing this phenomenon is difficult as sensitive attributes may be causally linked with disease. Using multitask learning, we propose a method to directly test for the presence of shortcut learning in clinical ML systems and demonstrate its application to clinical tasks in radiology and dermatology. Finally, our approach reveals instances when shortcutting is not responsible for unfairness, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to fairness mitigation in medical AI."
372,CellSighter: a neural network to classify cells in highly multiplexed images,"Multiplexed imaging enables measurement of multiple proteins in situ, offering an unprecedented opportunity to chart various cell types and states in tissues. However, cell classification, the task of identifying the type of individual cells, remains challenging, labor-intensive, and limiting to throughput. Here, we present CellSighter, a deep-learning based pipeline to accelerate cell classification in multiplexed images. Given a small training set of expert-labeled images, CellSighter outputs the label probabilities for all cells in new images. CellSighter achieves over 80% accuracy for major cell types across imaging platforms, which approaches inter-observer concordance. Ablation studies and simulations show that CellSighter is able to generalize its training data and learn features of protein expression levels, as well as spatial features such as subcellular expression patterns. CellSighter’s design reduces overfitting, and it can be trained with only thousands or even hundreds of labeled examples. CellSighter also outputs a prediction confidence, allowing downstream experts control over the results. Altogether, CellSighter drastically reduces hands-on time for cell classification in multiplexed images, while improving accuracy and consistency across datasets."
373,Next generation pan-cancer blood proteome profiling using proximity extension assay,"A comprehensive characterization of blood proteome profiles in cancer patients can contribute to a better understanding of the disease etiology, resulting in earlier diagnosis, risk stratification and better monitoring of the different cancer subtypes. Here, we describe the use of next generation protein profiling to explore the proteome signature in blood across patients representing many of the major cancer types. Plasma profiles of 1463 proteins from more than 1400 cancer patients are measured in minute amounts of blood collected at the time of diagnosis and before treatment. An open access Disease Blood Atlas resource allows the exploration of the individual protein profiles in blood collected from the individual cancer patients. We also present studies in which classification models based on machine learning have been used for the identification of a set of proteins associated with each of the analyzed cancers. The implication for cancer precision medicine of next generation plasma profiling is discussed."
374,Atlas-scale single-cell multi-sample multi-condition data integration using scMerge2,"The recent emergence of multi-sample multi-condition single-cell multi-cohort studies allows researchers to investigate different cell states. The effective integration of multiple large-cohort studies promises biological insights into cells under different conditions that individual studies cannot provide. Here, we present scMerge2, a scalable algorithm that allows data integration of atlas-scale multi-sample multi-condition single-cell studies. We have generalized scMerge2 to enable the merging of millions of cells from single-cell studies generated by various single-cell technologies. Using a large COVID-19 data collection with over five million cells from 1000+ individuals, we demonstrate that scMerge2 enables multi-sample multi-condition scRNA-seq data integration from multiple cohorts and reveals signatures derived from cell-type expression that are more accurate in discriminating disease progression. Further, we demonstrate that scMerge2 can remove dataset variability in CyTOF, imaging mass cytometry and CITE-seq experiments, demonstrating its applicability to a broad spectrum of single-cell profiling technologies."
375,Integrated analysis of copy number variation-associated lncRNAs identifies candidates contributing to the etiologies of congenital kidney anomalies,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are disorders resulting from defects in the development of the kidneys and their outflow tract. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been identified as important genetic variations leading to CAKUT, whereas most CAKUT-associated CNVs cannot be attributed to a specific pathogenic gene. Here we construct coexpression networks involving long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within these CNVs (CNV-lncRNAs) using human kidney developmental transcriptomic data. The results show that CNV-lncRNAs encompassed in recurrent CAKUT associated CNVs have highly correlated expression with CAKUT genes in the developing kidneys. The regulatory effects of two hub CNV-lncRNAs (
HSALNG0134318
 in 22q11.2 and 
HSALNG0115943
 in 17q12) in the module most significantly enriched in known CAKUT genes (CAKUT_sig1, 
P
 =

) are validated experimentally. Our results indicate that the reduction of CNV-lncRNAs can downregulate CAKUT genes as predicted by our computational analyses. Furthermore, knockdown of 
HSALNG0134318
 would downregulate 
HSALNG0115943
 and affect kidney development related pathways. The results also indicate that the CAKUT_sig1 module has function significance involving multi-organ development. Overall, our findings suggest that CNV-lncRNAs play roles in regulating CAKUT genes, and the etiologies of CAKUT-associated CNVs should take account of effects on the noncoding genome."
376,Integrating full and partial genome sequences to decipher the global spread of canine rabies virus,"Despite the rapid growth in viral genome sequencing, statistical methods face challenges in handling historical viral endemic diseases with large amounts of underutilized partial sequence data. We propose a phylogenetic pipeline that harnesses both full and partial viral genome sequences to investigate historical pathogen spread between countries. Its application to rabies virus (RABV) yields precise dating and confident estimates of its geographic dispersal. By using full genomes and partial sequences, we reduce both geographic and genetic biases that often hinder studies that focus on specific genes. Our pipeline reveals an emergence of the present canine-mediated RABV between years 1301 and 1403 and reveals regional introductions over a 700-year period. This geographic reconstruction enables us to locate episodes of human-mediated introductions of RABV and examine the role that European colonization played in its spread. Our approach enables phylogeographic analysis of large and genetically diverse data sets for many viral pathogens."
377,Epidemiological drivers of transmissibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in England,"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progressed, distinct variants emerged and dominated in England. These variants, Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron were characterized by variations in transmissibility and severity. We used a robust mathematical model and Bayesian inference framework to analyse epidemiological surveillance data from England. We quantified the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), therapeutics, and vaccination on virus transmission and severity. Each successive variant had a higher intrinsic transmissibility. Omicron (BA.1) had the highest basic reproduction number at 8.4 (95% credible interval (CrI) 7.8-9.1). Varying levels of NPIs were crucial in controlling virus transmission until population immunity accumulated. Immune escape properties of Omicron decreased effective levels of immunity in the population by a third. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, we found Alpha had the highest basic infection fatality ratio (3.0%, 95% CrI 2.8-3.2), followed by Delta (2.1%, 95% CrI 1.9–2.4), Wildtype (1.2%, 95% CrI 1.1–1.2), and Omicron (0.7%, 95% CrI 0.6-0.8). Our findings highlight the importance of continued surveillance. Long-term strategies for monitoring and maintaining effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 are critical to inform the role of NPIs to effectively manage future variants with potentially higher intrinsic transmissibility and severe outcomes."
378,Regional genetic correlations highlight relationships between neurodegenerative disease loci and the immune system,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, are devastating complex diseases resulting in physical and psychological burdens on patients and their families. There have been important efforts to understand their genetic basis leading to the identification of disease risk-associated loci involved in several molecular mechanisms, including immune-related pathways. Regional, in contrast to genome-wide, genetic correlations between pairs of immune and neurodegenerative traits have not been comprehensively explored, but could uncover additional immune-mediated risk-associated loci. Here, we systematically assess the role of the immune system in five neurodegenerative diseases by estimating regional genetic correlations between these diseases and immune-cell-derived single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs). We also investigate correlations between diseases and protein levels. We observe significant (FDR < 0.01) correlations between sc-eQTLs and neurodegenerative diseases across 151 unique genes, spanning both the innate and adaptive immune systems, across most diseases tested. With Parkinson’s, for instance, 
RAB7L1
 in CD4+ naïve T cells is positively correlated and 
KANSL1-AS1
 is negatively correlated across all adaptive immune cell types. Follow-up colocalization highlight candidate causal risk genes. The outcomes of this study will improve our understanding of the immune component of neurodegeneration, which can warrant repurposing of existing immunotherapies to slow disease progression."
379,Mutational signature dynamics shaping the evolution of oesophageal adenocarcinoma,"A variety of mutational processes drive cancer development, but their dynamics across the entire disease spectrum from pre-cancerous to advanced neoplasia are poorly understood. We explore the mutagenic processes shaping oesophageal adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis in 997 instances comprising distinct stages of this malignancy, from Barrett Oesophagus to primary tumours and advanced metastatic disease. The mutational landscape is dominated by the C[T > C/G]T substitution enriched signatures SBS17a/b, which are linked with 
TP53
 mutations, increased proliferation, genomic instability and disease progression. The APOBEC mutagenesis signature is a weak but persistent signal amplified in primary tumours. We also identify prevalent alterations in DNA damage repair pathways, with homologous recombination, base and nucleotide excision repair and translesion synthesis mutated in up to 50% of the cohort, and surprisingly uncoupled from transcriptional activity. Among these, the presence of base excision repair deficiencies show remarkably poor prognosis in the cohort. In this work, we provide insights on the mutational aetiology and changes enabling the transition from pre-neoplastic to advanced oesophageal adenocarcinoma."
380,Sequence-based drug design as a concept in computational drug design,"Drug development based on target proteins has been a successful approach in recent decades. However, the conventional structure-based drug design (SBDD) pipeline is a complex, human-engineered process with multiple independently optimized steps. Here, we propose a sequence-to-drug concept for computational drug design based on protein sequence information by end-to-end differentiable learning. We validate this concept in three stages. First, we design TransformerCPI2.0 as a core tool for the concept, which demonstrates generalization ability across proteins and compounds. Second, we interpret the binding knowledge that TransformerCPI2.0 learned. Finally, we use TransformerCPI2.0 to discover new hits for challenging drug targets, and identify new target for an existing drug based on an inverse application of the concept. Overall, this proof-of-concept study shows that the sequence-to-drug concept adds a perspective on drug design. It can serve as an alternative method to SBDD, particularly for proteins that do not yet have high-quality 3D structures available."
381,HypoRiPPAtlas as an Atlas of hypothetical natural products for mass spectrometry database search,"Recent analyses of public microbial genomes have found over a million biosynthetic gene clusters, the natural products of the majority of which remain unknown. Additionally, GNPS harbors billions of mass spectra of natural products without known structures and biosynthetic genes. We bridge the gap between large-scale genome mining and mass spectral datasets for natural product discovery by developing HypoRiPPAtlas, an Atlas of hypothetical natural product structures, which is ready-to-use for in silico database search of tandem mass spectra. HypoRiPPAtlas is constructed by mining genomes using seq2ripp, a machine-learning tool for the prediction of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). In HypoRiPPAtlas, we identify RiPPs in microbes and plants. HypoRiPPAtlas could be extended to other natural product classes in the future by implementing corresponding biosynthetic logic. This study paves the way for large-scale explorations of biosynthetic pathways and chemical structures of microbial and plant RiPP classes."
382,Disruptor: Computational identification of oncogenic mutants disrupting protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions,"We report an Osprey-based computational protocol to prospectively identify oncogenic mutations that act via disruption of molecular interactions. It is applicable to analyse both protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces and it is validated on a dataset of clinically relevant mutations. In addition, it is used to predict previously uncharacterised patient mutations in CDK6 and p16 genes, which are experimentally confirmed to impair complex formation."
383,Discovering functionally important sites in proteins,"Proteins play important roles in biology, biotechnology and pharmacology, and missense variants are a common cause of disease. Discovering functionally important sites in proteins is a central but difficult problem because of the lack of large, systematic data sets. Sequence conservation can highlight residues that are functionally important but is often convoluted with a signal for preserving structural stability. We here present a machine learning method to predict functional sites by combining statistical models for protein sequences with biophysical models of stability. We train the model using multiplexed experimental data on variant effects and validate it broadly. We show how the model can be used to discover active sites, as well as regulatory and binding sites. We illustrate the utility of the model by prospective prediction and subsequent experimental validation on the functional consequences of missense variants in 
HPRT1
 which may cause Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and pinpoint the molecular mechanisms by which they cause disease."
384,Large-scale benchmarking of circRNA detection tools reveals large differences in sensitivity but not in precision,"The detection of circular RNA molecules (circRNAs) is typically based on short-read RNA sequencing data processed using computational tools. Numerous such tools have been developed, but a systematic comparison with orthogonal validation is missing. Here, we set up a circRNA detection tool benchmarking study, in which 16 tools detected more than 315,000 unique circRNAs in three deeply sequenced human cell types. Next, 1,516 predicted circRNAs were validated using three orthogonal methods. Generally, tool-specific precision is high and similar (median of 98.8%, 96.3% and 95.5% for qPCR, RNase R and amplicon sequencing, respectively) whereas the sensitivity and number of predicted circRNAs (ranging from 1,372 to 58,032) are the most significant differentiators. Of note, precision values are lower when evaluating low-abundance circRNAs. We also show that the tools can be used complementarily to increase detection sensitivity. Finally, we offer recommendations for future circRNA detection and validation."
385,SCENIC+: single-cell multiomic inference of enhancers and gene regulatory networks,"Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in individual cells provides an opportunity to decipher enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Here we present a method for the inference of enhancer-driven GRNs, called SCENIC+. SCENIC+ predicts genomic enhancers along with candidate upstream transcription factors (TFs) and links these enhancers to candidate target genes. To improve both recall and precision of TF identification, we curated and clustered a motif collection with more than 30,000 motifs. We benchmarked SCENIC+ on diverse datasets from different species, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, ENCODE cell lines, melanoma cell states and 
Drosophila
 retinal development. Next, we exploit SCENIC+ predictions to study conserved TFs, enhancers and GRNs between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally, we use SCENIC+ to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories and the effect of TF perturbations on cell state. SCENIC+ is available at

386,Deep structured learning for variant prioritization in Mendelian diseases,"Effective computer-aided or automated variant evaluations for monogenic diseases will expedite clinical diagnostic and research efforts of known and novel disease-causing genes. Here we introduce MAVERICK: a Mendelian Approach to Variant Effect pRedICtion built in Keras. MAVERICK is an ensemble of transformer-based neural networks that can classify a wide range of protein-altering single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels and assesses whether a variant would be pathogenic in the context of dominant or recessive inheritance. We demonstrate that MAVERICK outperforms all other major programs that assess pathogenicity in a Mendelian context. In a cohort of 644 previously solved patients with Mendelian diseases, MAVERICK ranks the causative pathogenic variant within the top five variants in over 95% of cases. Seventy-six percent of cases were solved by the top-ranked variant. MAVERICK ranks the causative pathogenic variant in hitherto novel disease genes within the first five candidate variants in 70% of cases. MAVERICK has already facilitated the identification of a novel disease gene causing a degenerative motor neuron disease. These results represent a significant step towards automated identification of causal variants in patients with Mendelian diseases."
387,Impact of misclassified defective proviruses on HIV reservoir measurements,"Most proviruses persisting in people living with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are defective. However, rarer intact proviruses almost always reinitiate viral rebound if ART stops. Therefore, assessing therapies to prevent viral rebound hinges on specifically quantifying intact proviruses. We evaluated the same samples from 10 male PWH on ART using the two-probe intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and near full length (nfl) Q4PCR. Both assays admitted similar ratios of intact to total HIV DNA, but IPDA found ~40-fold more intact proviruses. Neither assay suggested defective proviruses decay over 10 years. However, the mean intact half-lives were different: 108 months for IPDA and 65 months for Q4PCR. To reconcile this difference, we modeled additional longitudinal IPDA data and showed that decelerating intact decay could arise from very long-lived intact proviruses and/or misclassified defective proviruses: slowly decaying defective proviruses that are intact in IPDA probe locations (estimated up to 5%, in agreement with sequence library based predictions). The model also demonstrates how misclassification can lead to underestimated efficacy of therapies that exclusively reduce intact proviruses. We conclude that sensitive multi-probe assays combined with specific nfl-verified assays would be optimal to document absolute and changing levels of intact HIV proviruses."
388,Functional decomposition of metabolism allows a system-level quantification of fluxes and protein allocation towards specific metabolic functions,"Quantifying the contribution of individual molecular components to complex cellular processes is a grand challenge in systems biology. Here we establish a general theoretical framework (Functional Decomposition of Metabolism, FDM) to quantify the contribution of every metabolic reaction to metabolic functions, e.g. the synthesis of biomass building blocks. FDM allowed for a detailed quantification of the energy and biosynthesis budget for growing 
Escherichia coli
 cells. Surprisingly, the ATP generated during the biosynthesis of building blocks from glucose almost balances the demand from protein synthesis, the largest energy expenditure known for growing cells. This leaves the bulk of the energy generated by fermentation and respiration unaccounted for, thus challenging the common notion that energy is a key growth-limiting resource. Moreover, FDM together with proteomics enables the quantification of enzymes contributing towards each metabolic function, allowing for a first-principle formulation of a coarse-grained model of global protein allocation based on the structure of the metabolic network."

390,Hidden modes of DNA binding by human nuclear receptors,"Human nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of ligand-responsive transcription factors that have central roles in cellular function. Their malfunction is linked to numerous diseases, and the ability to modulate their activity with synthetic ligands has yielded 16% of all FDA-approved drugs. NRs regulate distinct gene networks, however they often function from genomic sites that lack known binding motifs. Here, to annotate genomic binding sites of known and unexamined NRs more accurately, we use high-throughput SELEX to comprehensively map DNA binding site preferences of all full-length human NRs, in complex with their ligands. Furthermore, to identify non-obvious binding sites buried in DNA–protein interactomes, we develop 
MinSeq Find
, a search algorithm based on the MinTerm concept from electrical engineering and digital systems design. The resulting 
Min
Term 
seq

s
et (MinSeqs) reveal a constellation of binding sites that more effectively annotate NR-binding profiles in cells. MinSeqs also unmask binding sites created or disrupted by 52,106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human diseases. By implicating druggable NRs as hidden drivers of multiple human diseases, our results not only reveal new biological roles of NRs, but they also provide a resource for drug-repurposing and precision medicine."
391,Multi-batch single-cell comparative atlas construction by deep learning disentanglement,"Cell state atlases constructed through single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis are powerful tools for analyzing the effects of genetic and drug treatment-induced perturbations on complex cell systems. Comparative analysis of such atlases can yield new insights into cell state and trajectory alterations. Perturbation experiments often require that single-cell assays be carried out in multiple batches, which can introduce technical distortions that confound the comparison of biological quantities between different batches. Here we propose CODAL, a variational autoencoder-based statistical model which uses a mutual information regularization technique to explicitly disentangle factors related to technical and biological effects. We demonstrate CODAL’s capacity for batch-confounded cell type discovery when applied to simulated datasets and embryonic development atlases with gene knockouts. CODAL improves the representation of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq modalities, yields interpretable modules of biological variation, and enables the generalization of other count-based generative models to multi-batched data."
392,Detecting diagnostic features in MS/MS spectra of post-translationally modified peptides,"Post-translational modifications are an area of great interest in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, with a surge in methods to detect them in recent years. However, post-translational modifications can introduce complexity into proteomics searches by fragmenting in unexpected ways, ultimately hindering the detection of modified peptides. To address these deficiencies, we present a fully automated method to find diagnostic spectral features for any modification. The features can be incorporated into proteomics search engines to improve modified peptide recovery and localization. We show the utility of this approach by interrogating fragmentation patterns for a cysteine-reactive chemoproteomic probe, RNA-crosslinked peptides, sialic acid-containing glycopeptides, and ADP-ribosylated peptides. We also analyze the interactions between a diagnostic ion’s intensity and its statistical properties. This method has been incorporated into the open-search annotation tool PTM-Shepherd and the FragPipe computational platform."
393,Analysis of DIA proteomics data using MSFragger-DIA and FragPipe computational platform,"Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has been increasingly used in quantitative proteomics studies. Here, we present a fast and sensitive approach for direct peptide identification from DIA data, MSFragger-DIA, which leverages the unmatched speed of the fragment ion indexing-based search engine MSFragger. Different from most existing methods, MSFragger-DIA conducts a database search of the DIA tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra prior to spectral feature detection and peak tracing across the LC dimension. To streamline the analysis of DIA data and enable easy reproducibility, we integrate MSFragger-DIA into the FragPipe computational platform for seamless support of peptide identification and spectral library building from DIA, data-dependent acquisition (DDA), or both data types combined. We compare MSFragger-DIA with other DIA tools, such as DIA-Umpire based workflow in FragPipe, Spectronaut, DIA-NN library-free, and MaxDIA. We demonstrate the fast, sensitive, and accurate performance of MSFragger-DIA across a variety of sample types and data acquisition schemes, including single-cell proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and large-scale tumor proteome profiling studies."
394,A model for organization and regulation of nuclear condensates by gene activity,"Condensation by phase separation has recently emerged as a mechanism underlying many nuclear compartments essential for cellular functions. Nuclear condensates enrich nucleic acids and proteins, localize to specific genomic regions, and often promote gene expression. How diverse properties of nuclear condensates are shaped by gene organization and activity is poorly understood. Here, we develop a physics-based model to interrogate how spatially-varying transcription activity impacts condensate properties and dynamics. Our model predicts that spatial clustering of active genes can enable precise localization and de novo nucleation of condensates. Strong clustering and high activity results in aspherical condensate morphologies. Condensates can flow towards distant gene clusters and competition between multiple clusters lead to stretched morphologies and activity-dependent repositioning. Overall, our model predicts and recapitulates morphological and dynamical features of diverse nuclear condensates and offers a unified mechanistic framework to study the interplay between non-equilibrium processes, spatially-varying transcription, and multicomponent condensates in cell biology."
395,Turnover number predictions for kinetically uncharacterized enzymes using machine and deep learning,"The turnover number 
k
cat
, a measure of enzyme efficiency, is central to understanding cellular physiology and resource allocation. As experimental 
k
cat
 estimates are unavailable for the vast majority of enzymatic reactions, the development of accurate computational prediction methods is highly desirable. However, existing machine learning models are limited to a single, well-studied organism, or they provide inaccurate predictions except for enzymes that are highly similar to proteins in the training set. Here, we present TurNuP, a general and organism-independent model that successfully predicts turnover numbers for natural reactions of wild-type enzymes. We constructed model inputs by representing complete chemical reactions through differential reaction fingerprints and by representing enzymes through a modified and re-trained Transformer Network model for protein sequences. TurNuP outperforms previous models and generalizes well even to enzymes that are not similar to proteins in the training set. Parameterizing metabolic models with TurNuP-predicted 
k
cat
 values leads to improved proteome allocation predictions. To provide a powerful and convenient tool for the study of molecular biochemistry and physiology, we implemented a TurNuP web server."
396,Trackable and scalable LC-MS metabolomics data processing using asari,"Significant challenges remain in the computational processing of data from liquid chomratography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic experiments into metabolite features. In this study, we examine the issues of provenance and reproducibility using the current software tools. Inconsistency among the tools examined is attributed to the deficiencies of mass alignment and controls of feature quality. To address these issues, we develop the open-source software tool asari for LC-MS metabolomics data processing. Asari is designed with a set of specific algorithmic framework and data structures, and all steps are explicitly trackable. Asari compares favorably to other tools in feature detection and quantification. It offers substantial improvement in computational performance over current tools, and it is highly scalable."
397,High throughput single cell long-read sequencing analyses of same-cell genotypes and phenotypes in human tumors,"Single-cell nanopore sequencing of full-length mRNAs transforms single-cell multi-omics studies. However, challenges include high sequencing errors and dependence on short-reads and/or barcode whitelists. To address these, we develop scNanoGPS to calculate same-cell genotypes (mutations) and phenotypes (gene/isoform expressions) without short-read nor whitelist guidance. We apply scNanoGPS onto 23,587 long-read transcriptomes from 4 tumors and 2 cell-lines. Standalone, scNanoGPS deconvolutes error-prone long-reads into single-cells and single-molecules, and simultaneously accesses both phenotypes and genotypes of individual cells. Our analyses reveal that tumor and stroma/immune cells express distinct combination of isoforms (DCIs). In a kidney tumor, we identify 924 DCI genes involved in cell-type-specific functions such as 
PDE10A
 in tumor cells and 
CCL3
 in lymphocytes. Transcriptome-wide mutation analyses identify many cell-type-specific mutations including 
VEGFA
 mutations in tumor cells and 
HLA-A
 mutations in immune cells, highlighting the critical roles of different mutant populations in tumors. Together, scNanoGPS facilitates applications of single-cell long-read sequencing technologies."
398,Spatial cellular architecture predicts prognosis in glioblastoma,"Intra-tumoral heterogeneity and cell-state plasticity are key drivers for the therapeutic resistance of glioblastoma. Here, we investigate the association between spatial cellular organization and glioblastoma prognosis. Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, we develop a deep learning model to predict transcriptional subtypes of glioblastoma cells from histology images. Employing this model, we phenotypically analyze 40 million tissue spots from 410 patients and identify consistent associations between tumor architecture and prognosis across two independent cohorts. Patients with poor prognosis exhibit higher proportions of tumor cells expressing a hypoxia-induced transcriptional program. Furthermore, a clustering pattern of astrocyte-like tumor cells is associated with worse prognosis, while dispersion and connection of the astrocytes with other transcriptional subtypes correlate with decreased risk. To validate these results, we develop a separate deep learning model that utilizes histology images to predict prognosis. Applying this model to spatial transcriptomics data reveal survival-associated regional gene expression programs. Overall, our study presents a scalable approach to unravel the transcriptional heterogeneity of glioblastoma and establishes a critical connection between spatial cellular architecture and clinical outcomes."
399,Large depth-of-field ultra-compact microscope by progressive optimization and deep learning,"The optical microscope is customarily an instrument of substantial size and expense but limited performance. Here we report an integrated microscope that achieves optical performance beyond a commercial microscope with a 5×, NA 0.1 objective but only at 0.15 cm
3
 and 0.5 g, whose size is five orders of magnitude smaller than that of a conventional microscope. To achieve this, a progressive optimization pipeline is proposed which systematically optimizes both aspherical lenses and diffractive optical elements with over 30 times memory reduction compared to the end-to-end optimization. By designing a simulation-supervision deep neural network for spatially varying deconvolution during optical design, we accomplish over 10 times improvement in the depth-of-field compared to traditional microscopes with great generalization in a wide variety of samples. To show the unique advantages, the integrated microscope is equipped in a cell phone without any accessories for the application of portable diagnostics. We believe our method provides a new framework for the design of miniaturized high-performance imaging systems by integrating aspherical optics, computational optics, and deep learning."
400,The role of vaccination and public awareness in forecasts of Mpox incidence in the United Kingdom,"Beginning in May 2022, Mpox virus spread rapidly in high-income countries through close human-to-human contact primarily amongst communities of gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Behavioural change arising from increased knowledge and health warnings may have reduced the rate of transmission and modified Vaccinia-based vaccination is likely to be an effective longer-term intervention. We investigate the UK epidemic presenting 26-week projections using a stochastic discrete-population transmission model which includes GBMSM status, rate of formation of new sexual partnerships, and clique partitioning of the population. The Mpox cases peaked in mid-July; our analysis is that the decline was due to decreased transmission rate per infected individual and infection-induced immunity among GBMSM, especially those with the highest rate of new partners. Vaccination did not cause Mpox incidence to turn over, however, we predict that a rebound in cases due to behaviour reversion was prevented by high-risk group-targeted vaccination."
401,SCS: cell segmentation for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics promises to greatly improve our understanding of tissue organization and cell–cell interactions. While most current platforms for spatial transcriptomics only offer multi-cellular resolution, with 10–15 cells per spot, recent technologies provide a much denser spot placement leading to subcellular resolution. A key challenge for these newer methods is cell segmentation and the assignment of spots to cells. Traditional image-based segmentation methods are limited and do not make full use of the information profiled by spatial transcriptomics. Here we present subcellular spatial transcriptomics cell segmentation (SCS), which combines imaging data with sequencing data to improve cell segmentation accuracy. SCS assigns spots to cells by adaptively learning the position of each spot relative to the center of its cell using a transformer neural network. SCS was tested on two new subcellular spatial transcriptomics technologies and outperformed traditional image-based segmentation methods. SCS achieved better accuracy, identified more cells and provided more realistic cell size estimation. Subcellular analysis of RNAs using SCS spot assignments provides information on RNA localization and further supports the segmentation results."
402,Significance analysis for clustering with single-cell RNA-sequencing data,"Unsupervised clustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data enables the identification of distinct cell populations. However, the most widely used clustering algorithms are heuristic and do not formally account for statistical uncertainty. We find that not addressing known sources of variability in a statistically rigorous manner can lead to overconfidence in the discovery of novel cell types. Here we extend a previous method, significance of hierarchical clustering, to propose a model-based hypothesis testing approach that incorporates significance analysis into the clustering algorithm and permits statistical evaluation of clusters as distinct cell populations. We also adapt this approach to permit statistical assessment on the clusters reported by any algorithm. Finally, we extend these approaches to account for batch structure. We benchmarked our approach against popular clustering workflows, demonstrating improved performance. To show practical utility, we applied our approach to the Human Lung Cell Atlas and an atlas of the mouse cerebellar cortex, identifying several cases of over-clustering and recapitulating experimentally validated cell type definitions."
403,nnSVG for the scalable identification of spatially variable genes using nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes,"Feature selection to identify spatially variable genes or other biologically informative genes is a key step during analyses of spatially-resolved transcriptomics data. Here, we propose nnSVG, a scalable approach to identify spatially variable genes based on nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes. Our method (i) identifies genes that vary in expression continuously across the entire tissue or within a priori defined spatial domains, (ii) uses gene-specific estimates of length scale parameters within the Gaussian process models, and (iii) scales linearly with the number of spatial locations. We demonstrate the performance of our method using experimental data from several technological platforms and simulations. A software implementation is available at 
https://bioconductor.org/packages/nnSVG

404,Intermediately synchronised brain states optimise trade-off between subject specificity and predictive capacity,"Functional connectivity (FC) refers to the statistical dependencies between activity of distinct brain areas. To study temporal fluctuations in FC within the duration of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning session, researchers have proposed the computation of an edge time series (ETS) and their derivatives. Evidence suggests that FC is driven by a few time points of high-amplitude co-fluctuation (HACF) in the ETS, which may also contribute disproportionately to interindividual differences. However, it remains unclear to what degree different time points actually contribute to brain-behaviour associations. Here, we systematically evaluate this question by assessing the predictive utility of FC estimates at different levels of co-fluctuation using machine learning (ML) approaches. We demonstrate that time points of lower and intermediate co-fluctuation levels provide overall highest subject specificity as well as highest predictive capacity of individual-level phenotypes."
405,Genome-wide association analysis and Mendelian randomization proteomics identify drug targets for heart failure,"We conduct a large-scale meta-analysis of heart failure genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisting of over 90,000 heart failure cases and more than 1 million control individuals of European ancestry to uncover novel genetic determinants for heart failure. Using the GWAS results and blood protein quantitative loci, we perform Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses on human proteins to provide putative causal evidence for the role of druggable proteins in the genesis of heart failure. We identify 39 genome-wide significant heart failure risk variants, of which 18 are previously unreported. Using a combination of Mendelian randomization proteomics and genetic cis-only colocalization analyses, we identify 10 additional putatively causal genes for heart failure. Findings from GWAS and Mendelian randomization-proteomics identify seven (

406,DNA 5-methylcytosine detection and methylation phasing using PacBio circular consensus sequencing,"Long single-molecular sequencing technologies, such as PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) and nanopore sequencing, are advantageous in detecting DNA 5-methylcytosine in CpGs (5mCpGs), especially in repetitive genomic regions. However, existing methods for detecting 5mCpGs using PacBio CCS are less accurate and robust. Here, we present ccsmeth, a deep-learning method to detect DNA 5mCpGs using CCS reads. We sequence polymerase-chain-reaction treated and M.SssI-methyltransferase treated DNA of one human sample using PacBio CCS for training ccsmeth. Using long (≥10 Kb) CCS reads, ccsmeth achieves 0.90 accuracy and 0.97 Area Under the Curve on 5mCpG detection at single-molecule resolution. At the genome-wide site level, ccsmeth achieves >0.90 correlations with bisulfite sequencing and nanopore sequencing using only 10× reads. Furthermore, we develop a Nextflow pipeline, ccsmethphase, to detect haplotype-aware methylation using CCS reads, and then sequence a Chinese family trio to validate it. ccsmeth and ccsmethphase can be robust and accurate tools for detecting DNA 5-methylcytosines."
407,Glycopeptide database search and de novo sequencing with PEAKS GlycanFinder enable highly sensitive glycoproteomics,"Here we present GlycanFinder, a database search and de novo sequencing tool for the analysis of intact glycopeptides from mass spectrometry data. GlycanFinder integrates peptide-based and glycan-based search strategies to address the challenge of complex fragmentation of glycopeptides. A deep learning model is designed to capture glycan tree structures and their fragment ions for de novo sequencing of glycans that do not exist in the database. We performed extensive analyses to validate the false discovery rates (FDRs) at both peptide and glycan levels and to evaluate GlycanFinder based on comprehensive benchmarks from previous community-based studies. Our results show that GlycanFinder achieved comparable performance to other leading glycoproteomics softwares in terms of both FDR control and the number of identifications. Moreover, GlycanFinder was also able to identify glycopeptides not found in existing databases. Finally, we conducted a mass spectrometry experiment for antibody N-linked glycosylation profiling that could distinguish isomeric peptides and glycans in four immunoglobulin G subclasses, which had been a challenging problem to previous studies."
408,Leveraging spatial transcriptomics data to recover cell locations in single-cell RNA-seq with CeLEry,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in health and disease. However, the lack of physical relationships among dissociated cells has limited its applications. To address this issue, we present CeLEry (

), a supervised deep learning algorithm that leverages gene expression and spatial location relationships learned from spatial transcriptomics to recover the spatial origins of cells in scRNA-seq. CeLEry has an optional data augmentation procedure via a variational autoencoder, which improves the method’s robustness and allows it to overcome noise in scRNA-seq data. We show that CeLEry can infer the spatial origins of cells in scRNA-seq at multiple levels, including 2D location and spatial domain of a cell, while also providing uncertainty estimates for the recovered locations. Our comprehensive benchmarking evaluations on multiple datasets generated from brain and cancer tissues using Visium, MERSCOPE, MERFISH, and Xenium demonstrate that CeLEry can reliably recover the spatial location information for cells using scRNA-seq data."
409,SpatialDM for rapid identification of spatially co-expressed ligand–receptor and revealing cell–cell communication patterns,"Cell-cell communication is a key aspect of dissecting the complex cellular microenvironment. Existing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics-based methods primarily focus on identifying cell-type pairs for a specific interaction, while less attention has been paid to the prioritisation of interaction features or the identification of interaction spots in the spatial context. Here, we introduce SpatialDM, a statistical model and toolbox leveraging a bivariant Moran’s statistic to detect spatially co-expressed ligand and receptor pairs, their local interacting spots (single-spot resolution), and communication patterns. By deriving an analytical null distribution, this method is scalable to millions of spots and shows accurate and robust performance in various simulations. On multiple datasets including melanoma, Ventricular-Subventricular Zone, and intestine, SpatialDM reveals promising communication patterns and identifies differential interactions between conditions, hence enabling the discovery of context-specific cell cooperation and signalling."
410,Detecting temporal and spatial malaria patterns from first antenatal care visits,"Pregnant women attending first antenatal care (ANC) visits represent a promising malaria surveillance target in Sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the spatio-temporal relationship between malaria trends at ANC (
n

n
 = 3933) and at health facilities (
n
 = 15,467) in southern Mozambique (2016–2019). ANC 
P. falciparum
 rates detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction mirrored rates in children, regardless of gravidity and HIV status (Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] > 0.8, χ²<1.1), with a 2–3 months lag. Only at rapid diagnostic test detection limits at moderate-to-high transmission, did multigravidae show lower rates than children (PCC = 0.61, 95%CI[−0.12–0.94]). Seroprevalence against the pregnancy-specific antigen VAR2CSA reflected declining malaria trends (PCC = 0.74, 95%CI[0.24–0.77]). 60% (9/15) of hotspots detected from health facility data (
n
 = 6662) using a novel hotspot detector, EpiFRIenDs, were also identified with ANC data (
n
 = 3616). Taken together, we show that ANC-based malaria surveillance offers contemporary information on temporal trends and geographic distribution of malaria burden in the community."
411,MOBILE pipeline enables identification of context-specific networks and regulatory mechanisms,"Robust identification of context-specific network features that control cellular phenotypes remains a challenge. We here introduce MOBILE (Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles) to nominate molecular features associated with cellular phenotypes and pathways. First, we use MOBILE to nominate mechanisms of interferon-γ (IFNγ) regulated PD-L1 expression. Our analyses suggest that IFNγ-controlled PD-L1 expression involves 
BST2
, 
CLIC2
, 
FAM83D
, 
ACSL5
, and 
HIST2H2AA3
 genes, which were supported by prior literature. We also compare networks activated by related family members transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and find that differences in ligand-induced changes in cell size and clustering properties are related to differences in laminin/collagen pathway activity. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability and adaptability of MOBILE by analyzing publicly available molecular datasets to investigate breast cancer subtype specific networks. Given the ever-growing availability of multi-omics datasets, we envision that MOBILE will be broadly useful for identification of context-specific molecular features and pathways."
412,Joint analysis of phenotype-effect-generation identifies loci associated with grain quality traits in rice hybrids,"Genetic improvement of grain quality is more challenging in hybrid rice than in inbred rice due to additional nonadditive effects such as dominance. Here, we describe a pipeline developed for joint analysis of phenotypes, effects, and generations (JPEG). As a demonstration, we analyze 12 grain quality traits of 113 inbred lines (male parents), five tester lines (female parents), and 565 (113×5) of their hybrids. We sequence the parents for single nucleotide polymorphisms calling and infer the genotypes of the hybrids. Genome-wide association studies with JPEG identify 128 loci associated with at least one of the 12 traits, including 44, 97, and 13 loci with additive effects, dominant effects, and both additive and dominant effects, respectively. These loci together explain more than 30% of the genetic variation in hybrid performance for each of the traits. The JEPG statistical pipeline can help to identify superior crosses for breeding rice hybrids with improved grain quality."
413,An analytical framework for decoding cell type-specific genetic variation of gene regulation,"A deeper understanding of genetic regulation and functional mechanisms underlying genetic associations with complex traits and diseases is impeded by cellular heterogeneity and linkage disequilibrium. To address these limits, we introduce Huatuo, a framework to decode genetic variation of gene regulation at cell type and single-nucleotide resolutions by integrating deep-learning-based variant predictions with population-based association analyses. We apply Huatuo to generate a comprehensive cell type-specific genetic variation landscape across human tissues and further evaluate their potential roles in complex diseases and traits. Finally, we show that Huatuo’s inferences permit prioritizations of driver cell types associated with complex traits and diseases and allow for systematic insights into the mechanisms of phenotype-causal genetic variation."
414,Targeted cross-linker delivery for the in situ mapping of protein conformations and interactions in mitochondria,"Current methods for intracellular protein analysis mostly require the separation of specific organelles or changes to the intracellular environment. However, the functions of proteins are determined by their native microenvironment as they usually form complexes with ions, nucleic acids, and other proteins. Here, we show a method for in situ cross-linking and analysis of mitochondrial proteins in living cells. By using the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles functionalized with dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) to deliver protein cross-linkers into mitochondria, we subsequently analyze the cross-linked proteins using mass spectrometry. With this method, we identify a total of 74 pairs of protein-protein interactions that do not exist in the STRING database. Interestingly, our data on mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins ( ~ 94%) are also consistent with the experimental or predicted structural analysis of these proteins. Thus, we provide a promising technology platform for in situ defining protein analysis in cellular organelles under their native microenvironment."
415,CherryML: scalable maximum likelihood estimation of phylogenetic models,"Phylogenetic models of molecular evolution are central to numerous biological applications spanning diverse timescales, from hundreds of millions of years involving orthologous proteins to just tens of days relating to single cells within an organism. A fundamental problem in these applications is estimating model parameters, for which maximum likelihood estimation is typically employed. Unfortunately, maximum likelihood estimation is a computationally expensive task, in some cases prohibitively so. To address this challenge, we here introduce CherryML, a broadly applicable method that achieves several orders of magnitude speedup by using a quantized composite likelihood over cherries in the trees. The massive speedup offered by our method should enable researchers to consider more complex and biologically realistic models than previously possible. Here we demonstrate CherryML’s utility by applying it to estimate a general 400 × 400 rate matrix for residue–residue coevolution at contact sites in three-dimensional protein structures; we estimate that using current state-of-the-art methods such as the expectation-maximization algorithm for the same task would take >100,000 times longer."
416,MultiVI: deep generative model for the integration of multimodal data,"Jointly profiling the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and other molecular properties of single cells offers a powerful way to study cellular diversity. Here we present MultiVI, a probabilistic model to analyze such multiomic data and leverage it to enhance single-modality datasets. MultiVI creates a joint representation that allows an analysis of all modalities included in the multiomic input data, even for cells for which one or more modalities are missing. It is available at

417,A comparison of single-coverage and multi-coverage metagenomic binning reveals extensive hidden contamination,"Metagenomic binning has revolutionized the study of uncultured microorganisms. Here we compare single- and multi-coverage binning on the same set of samples, and demonstrate that multi-coverage binning produces better results than single-coverage binning and identifies contaminant contigs and chimeric bins that other approaches miss. While resource expensive, multi-coverage binning is a superior approach and should always be performed over single-coverage binning."
418,Parallel and convergent genomic changes underlie independent subterranean colonization across beetles,"Adaptation to life in caves is often accompanied by dramatically convergent changes across distantly related taxa, epitomized by the loss or reduction of eyes and pigmentation. Nevertheless, the genomic underpinnings underlying cave-related phenotypes are largely unexplored from a macroevolutionary perspective. Here we investigate genome-wide gene evolutionary dynamics in three distantly related beetle tribes with at least six instances of independent colonization of subterranean habitats, inhabiting both aquatic and terrestrial underground systems. Our results indicate that remarkable gene repertoire changes mainly driven by gene family expansions occurred prior to underground colonization in the three tribes, suggesting that genomic exaptation may have facilitated a strict subterranean lifestyle parallelly across beetle lineages. The three tribes experienced both parallel and convergent changes in the evolutionary dynamics of their gene repertoires. These findings pave the way towards a deeper understanding of the evolution of the genomic toolkit in hypogean fauna."
419,Learning-induced reorganization of number neurons and emergence of numerical representations in a biologically inspired neural network,"Number sense, the ability to decipher quantity, forms the foundation for mathematical cognition. How number sense emerges with learning is, however, not known. Here we use a biologically-inspired neural architecture comprising cortical layers V1, V2, V3, and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) to investigate how neural representations change with numerosity training. Learning dramatically reorganized neuronal tuning properties at both the single unit and population levels, resulting in the emergence of sharply-tuned representations of numerosity in the IPS layer. Ablation analysis revealed that spontaneous number neurons observed prior to learning were not critical to formation of number representations post-learning. Crucially, multidimensional scaling of population responses revealed the emergence of absolute and relative magnitude representations of quantity, including mid-point anchoring. These learnt representations may underlie changes from logarithmic to cyclic and linear mental number lines that are characteristic of number sense development in humans. Our findings elucidate mechanisms by which learning builds novel representations supporting number sense."
420,Cell facilitation promotes growth and survival under drug pressure in breast cancer,"The interplay of positive and negative interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant cells influences the effectiveness of treatment in heterogeneous cancer cell populations. Here, we study interactions between estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lineages that are sensitive and resistant to ribociclib-induced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibition. In mono- and coculture, we find that sensitive cells grow and compete more effectively in the absence of treatment. During treatment with ribociclib, sensitive cells survive and proliferate better when grown together with resistant cells than when grown in monoculture, termed facilitation in ecology. Molecular, protein, and genomic analyses show that resistant cells increase metabolism and production of estradiol, a highly active estrogen metabolite, and increase estrogen signaling in sensitive cells to promote facilitation in coculture. Adding estradiol in monoculture provides sensitive cells with increased resistance to therapy and cancels facilitation in coculture. Under partial inhibition of estrogen signaling through low-dose endocrine therapy, estradiol supplied by resistant cells facilitates sensitive cell growth. However, a more complete blockade of estrogen signaling, through higher-dose endocrine therapy, diminished the facilitative growth of sensitive cells. Mathematical modeling quantifies the strength of competition and facilitation during CDK4/6 inhibition and predicts that blocking facilitation has the potential to control both resistant and sensitive cancer cell populations and inhibit the emergence of a refractory population during cell cycle therapy."
421,"Deep learning enables fast, gentle STED microscopy","STED microscopy is widely used to image subcellular structures with super-resolution. Here, we report that restoring STED images with deep learning can mitigate photobleaching and photodamage by reducing the pixel dwell time by one or two orders of magnitude. Our method allows for efficient and robust restoration of noisy 2D and 3D STED images with multiple targets and facilitates long-term imaging of mitochondrial dynamics."
422,Multiscale analysis of pangenomes enables improved representation of genomic diversity for repetitive and clinically relevant genes,"Advancements in sequencing technologies and assembly methods enable the regular production of high-quality genome assemblies characterizing complex regions. However, challenges remain in efficiently interpreting variation at various scales, from smaller tandem repeats to megabase rearrangements, across many human genomes. We present a PanGenome Research Tool Kit (PGR-TK) enabling analyses of complex pangenome structural and haplotype variation at multiple scales. We apply the graph decomposition methods in PGR-TK to the class II major histocompatibility complex demonstrating the importance of the human pangenome for analyzing complicated regions. Moreover, we investigate the Y-chromosome genes, 
DAZ1

DAZ2
/
DAZ3
/
DAZ4
, of which structural variants have been linked to male infertility, and X-chromosome genes 
OPN1LW
 and 
OPN1MW
 linked to eye disorders. We further showcase PGR-TK across 395 complex repetitive medically important genes. This highlights the power of PGR-TK to resolve complex variation in regions of the genome that were previously too complex to analyze."
423,Histone exchange sensors reveal variant specific dynamics in mouse embryonic stem cells,"Eviction of histones from nucleosomes and their exchange with newly synthesized or alternative variants is a central epigenetic determinant. Here, we define the genome-wide occupancy and exchange pattern of canonical and non-canonical histone variants in mouse embryonic stem cells by genetically encoded exchange sensors. While exchange of all measured variants scales with transcription, we describe variant-specific associations with transcription elongation and Polycomb binding. We found considerable exchange of H3.1 and H2B variants in heterochromatin and repeat elements, contrasting the occupancy and little exchange of H3.3 in these regions. This unexpected association between H3.3 occupancy and exchange of canonical variants is also evident in active promoters and enhancers, and further validated by reduced H3.1 dynamics following depletion of H3.3-specific chaperone, HIRA. Finally, analyzing transgenic mice harboring H3.1 or H3.3 sensors demonstrates the vast potential of this system for studying histone exchange and its impact on gene expression regulation in vivo."
424,Learning fast and fine-grained detection of amyloid neuropathologies from coarse-grained expert labels,"Precise, scalable, and quantitative evaluation of whole slide images is crucial in neuropathology. We release a deep learning model for rapid object detection and precise information on the identification, locality, and counts of cored plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We trained this object detector using a repurposed image-tile dataset without any human-drawn bounding boxes. We evaluated the detector on a new manually-annotated dataset of whole slide images (WSIs) from three institutions, four staining procedures, and four human experts. The detector matched the cohort of neuropathology experts, achieving 0.64 (model) vs. 0.64 (cohort) average precision (AP) for cored plaques and 0.75 vs. 0.51 AP for CAAs at a 0.5 IOU threshold. It provided count and locality predictions that approximately correlated with gold-standard human CERAD-like WSI scoring (
p
 = 0.07 ± 0.10). The openly-available model can quickly score WSIs in minutes without a GPU on a standard workstation."
425,Hearing as adaptive cascaded envelope interpolation,"The human auditory system is designed to capture and encode sounds from our surroundings and conspecifics. However, the precise mechanisms by which it adaptively extracts the most important spectro-temporal information from sounds are still not fully understood. Previous auditory models have explained sound encoding at the cochlear level using static filter banks, but this vision is incompatible with the nonlinear and adaptive properties of the auditory system. Here we propose an approach that considers the cochlear processes as envelope interpolations inspired by cochlear physiology. It unifies linear and nonlinear adaptive behaviors into a single comprehensive framework that provides a data-driven understanding of auditory coding. It allows simulating a broad range of psychophysical phenomena from virtual pitches and combination tones to consonance and dissonance of harmonic sounds. It further predicts the properties of the cochlear filters such as frequency selectivity. Here we propose a possible link between the parameters of the model and the density of hair cells on the basilar membrane. Cascaded Envelope Interpolation may lead to improvements in sound processing for hearing aids by providing a non-linear, data-driven, way to preprocessing of acoustic signals consistent with peripheral processes."
426,Enzyme-substrate hybrid β-sheet controls geometry and water access to the γ-secretase active site,γ-Secretase is an aspartyl intramembrane protease that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) involved in Alzheimer’s disease pathology and other transmembrane proteins. Substrate-bound structures reveal a stable hybrid β-sheet immediately following the substrate scissile bond consisting of β1 and β2 from the enzyme and β3 from the substrate. Molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling simulations demonstrate that the hybrid β-sheet stability is strongly correlated with the formation of a stable cleavage-compatible active geometry and it also controls water access to the active site. The hybrid β-sheet is only stable for substrates with 3 or more C-terminal residues beyond the scissile bond. The simulation model allowed us to predict the effect of Pro and Phe mutations that weaken the formation of the hybrid β-sheet which were confirmed by experimental testing. Our study provides a direct explanation why γ-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in steps of 3 residues and how the hybrid β-sheet facilitates γ-secretase proteolysis.
427,Predicting in-hospital outcomes of patients with acute kidney injury,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is prevalent and a leading cause of in-hospital death worldwide. Early prediction of AKI-related clinical events and timely intervention for high-risk patients could improve outcomes. We develop a deep learning model based on a nationwide multicenter cooperative network across China that includes 7,084,339 hospitalized patients, to dynamically predict the risk of in-hospital death (primary outcome) and dialysis (secondary outcome) for patients who developed AKI during hospitalization. A total of 137,084 eligible patients with AKI constitute the analysis set. In the derivation cohort, the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for 24-h, 48-h, 72-h, and 7-day death are 95·05%, 94·23%, 93·53%, and 93·09%, respectively. For dialysis outcome, the AUROC of each time span are 88·32%, 83·31%, 83·20%, and 77·99%, respectively. The predictive performance is consistent in both internal and external validation cohorts. The model can predict important outcomes of patients with AKI, which could be helpful for the early management of AKI."
428,Joint inference of exclusivity patterns and recurrent trajectories from tumor mutation trees,"Cancer progression is an evolutionary process shaped by both deterministic and stochastic forces. Multi-region and single-cell sequencing of tumors enable high-resolution reconstruction of the mutational history of each tumor and highlight the extensive diversity across tumors and patients. Resolving the interactions among mutations and recovering recurrent evolutionary processes may offer greater opportunities for successful therapeutic strategies. To this end, we present a novel probabilistic framework, called TreeMHN, for the joint inference of exclusivity patterns and recurrent trajectories from a cohort of intra-tumor phylogenetic trees. Through simulations, we show that TreeMHN outperforms existing alternatives that can only focus on one aspect of the task. By analyzing datasets of blood, lung, and breast cancers, we find the most likely evolutionary trajectories and mutational patterns, consistent with and enriching our current understanding of tumorigenesis. Moreover, TreeMHN facilitates the prediction of tumor evolution and provides probabilistic measures on the next mutational events given a tumor tree, a prerequisite for evolution-guided treatment strategies."
429,CAJAL enables analysis and integration of single-cell morphological data using metric geometry,"High-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of single cells in their spatial context. However, summarizing the great diversity of complex cell shapes found in tissues and inferring associations with other single-cell data remains a challenge. Here, we present CAJAL, a general computational framework for the analysis and integration of single-cell morphological data. By building upon metric geometry, CAJAL infers cell morphology latent spaces where distances between points indicate the amount of physical deformation required to change the morphology of one cell into that of another. We show that cell morphology spaces facilitate the integration of single-cell morphological data across technologies and the inference of relations with other data, such as single-cell transcriptomic data. We demonstrate the utility of CAJAL with several morphological datasets of neurons and glia and identify genes associated with neuronal plasticity in 
C. elegans
. Our approach provides an effective strategy for integrating cell morphology data into single-cell omics analyses."
430,How soluble misfolded proteins bypass chaperones at the molecular level,"Subpopulations of soluble, misfolded proteins can bypass chaperones within cells. The extent of this phenomenon and how it happens at the molecular level are unknown. Through a meta-analysis of the experimental literature we find that in all quantitative protein refolding studies there is always a subpopulation of soluble but misfolded protein that does not fold in the presence of one or more chaperones, and can take days or longer to do so. Thus, some misfolded subpopulations commonly bypass chaperones. Using multi-scale simulation models we observe that the misfolded structures that bypass various chaperones can do so because their structures are highly native like, leading to a situation where chaperones do not distinguish between the folded and near-native-misfolded states. More broadly, these results provide a mechanism by which long-time scale changes in protein structure and function can persist in cells because some misfolded states can bypass components of the proteostasis machinery."
431,Multiplex-GAM: genome-wide identification of chromatin contacts yields insights overlooked by Hi-C,"Technology for measuring 3D genome topology is increasingly important for studying gene regulation, for genome assembly and for mapping of genome rearrangements. Hi-C and other ligation-based methods have become routine but have specific biases. Here, we develop multiplex-GAM, a faster and more affordable version of genome architecture mapping (GAM), a ligation-free technique that maps chromatin contacts genome-wide. We perform a detailed comparison of multiplex-GAM and Hi-C using mouse embryonic stem cells. When examining the strongest contacts detected by either method, we find that only one-third of these are shared. The strongest contacts specifically found in GAM often involve ‘active’ regions, including many transcribed genes and super-enhancers, whereas in Hi-C they more often contain ‘inactive’ regions. Our work shows that active genomic regions are involved in extensive complex contacts that are currently underestimated in ligation-based approaches, and highlights the need for orthogonal advances in genome-wide contact mapping technologies."
432,A pharmacoproteomic landscape of organotypic intervention responses in Gram-negative sepsis,"Sepsis is the major cause of mortality across intensive care units globally, yet details of accompanying pathological molecular events remain unclear. This knowledge gap has resulted in ineffective biomarker development and suboptimal treatment regimens to prevent and manage organ dysfunction/damage. Here, we used pharmacoproteomics to score time-dependent treatment impact in a murine 
Escherichia coli
 sepsis model after administering beta-lactam antibiotic meropenem (Mem) and/or the immunomodulatory glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (Gcc). Three distinct proteome response patterns were identified, which depended on the underlying proteotype for each organ. Gcc enhanced some positive proteome responses of Mem, including superior reduction of the inflammatory response in kidneys and partial restoration of sepsis-induced metabolic dysfunction. Mem introduced sepsis-independent perturbations in the mitochondrial proteome that Gcc counteracted. We provide a strategy for the quantitative and organotypic assessment of treatment effects of candidate therapies in relationship to dosing, timing, and potential synergistic intervention combinations during sepsis."
433,A data-driven approach for predicting the impact of drugs on the human microbiome,"Many medications can negatively impact the bacteria residing in our gut, depleting beneficial species, and causing adverse effects. To guide personalized pharmaceutical treatment, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of various drugs on the gut microbiome is needed, yet, to date, experimentally challenging to obtain. Towards this end, we develop a data-driven approach, integrating information about the chemical properties of each drug and the genomic content of each microbe, to systematically predict drug-microbiome interactions. We show that this framework successfully predicts outcomes of in-vitro pairwise drug-microbe experiments, as well as drug-induced microbiome dysbiosis in both animal models and clinical trials. Applying this methodology, we systematically map a large array of interactions between pharmaceuticals and human gut bacteria and demonstrate that medications’ anti-microbial properties are tightly linked to their adverse effects. This computational framework has the potential to unlock the development of personalized medicine and microbiome-based therapeutic approaches, improving outcomes and minimizing side effects."
434,Cancer genomes tolerate deleterious coding mutations through somatic copy number amplifications of wild-type regions,"Cancers evolve under the accumulation of thousands of somatic mutations and chromosomal aberrations. While most coding mutations are deleterious, almost all protein-coding genes lack detectable signals of negative selection. This raises the question of how tumors tolerate such large amounts of deleterious mutations. Using 8,690 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that copy number amplifications frequently cover haploinsufficient genes in mutation-prone regions. This could increase tolerance towards the deleterious impact of mutations by creating safe copies of wild-type regions and, hence, protecting the genes therein. Our findings demonstrate that these potential buffering events are highly influenced by gene functions, essentiality, and mutation impact and that they occur early during tumor evolution. We show how cancer type-specific mutation landscapes drive copy number alteration patterns across cancer types. Ultimately, our work paves the way for the detection of novel cancer vulnerabilities by revealing genes that fall within amplifications likely selected during evolution to mitigate the effect of mutations."
435,Biomedical knowledge graph learning for drug repurposing by extending guilt-by-association to multiple layers,"Computational drug repurposing aims to identify new indications for existing drugs by utilizing high-throughput data, often in the form of biomedical knowledge graphs. However, learning on biomedical knowledge graphs can be challenging due to the dominance of genes and a small number of drug and disease entities, resulting in less effective representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a “semantic multi-layer guilt-by-association"" approach that leverages the principle of guilt-by-association - “similar genes share similar functions"", at the drug-gene-disease level. Using this approach, our model DREAMwalk: Drug Repurposing through Exploring Associations using Multi-layer random walk uses our semantic information-guided random walk to generate drug and disease-populated node sequences, allowing for effective mapping of both drugs and diseases in a unified embedding space. Compared to state-of-the-art link prediction models, our approach improves drug-disease association prediction accuracy by up to 16.8%. Moreover, exploration of the embedding space reveals a well-aligned harmony between biological and semantic contexts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through repurposing case studies for breast carcinoma and Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting the potential of multi-layer guilt-by-association perspective for drug repurposing on biomedical knowledge graphs."
436,grandR: a comprehensive package for nucleotide conversion RNA-seq data analysis,"Metabolic labeling of RNA is a powerful technique for studying the temporal dynamics of gene expression. Nucleotide conversion approaches greatly facilitate the generation of data but introduce challenges for their analysis. Here we present grandR, a comprehensive package for quality control, differential gene expression analysis, kinetic modeling, and visualization of such data. We compare several existing methods for inference of RNA synthesis rates and half-lives using progressive labeling time courses. We demonstrate the need for recalibration of effective labeling times and introduce a Bayesian approach to study the temporal dynamics of RNA using snapshot experiments."
437,A convolutional neural network STIFMap reveals associations between stromal stiffness and EMT in breast cancer,"Intratumor heterogeneity associates with poor patient outcome. Stromal stiffening also accompanies cancer. Whether cancers demonstrate stiffness heterogeneity, and if this is linked to tumor cell heterogeneity remains unclear. We developed a method to measure the stiffness heterogeneity in human breast tumors that quantifies the stromal stiffness each cell experiences and permits visual registration with biomarkers of tumor progression. We present 
S

orce 
Map
 (STIFMap) which exploits computer vision to precisely automate atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation combined with a trained convolutional neural network to predict stromal elasticity with micron-resolution using collagen morphological features and ground truth AFM data. We registered high-elasticity regions within human breast tumors colocalizing with markers of mechanical activation and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The findings highlight the utility of STIFMap to assess mechanical heterogeneity of human tumors across length scales from single cells to whole tissues and implicates stromal stiffness in tumor cell heterogeneity."
438,Mechanistic studies of a lipase unveil effect of pH on hydrolysis products of small PET modules,"Biocatalysis is a key technology enabling plastic recycling. However, despite advances done in the development of plastic-degrading enzymes, the molecular mechanisms that govern their catalytic performance are poorly understood, hampering the engineering of more efficient enzyme-based technologies. In this work, we study the hydrolysis of PET-derived diesters and PET trimers catalyzed by the highly promiscuous lipase B from 
Candida antarctica
 (CALB) through QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations supported by experimental Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The computational studies reveal the role of the pH on the CALB regioselectivity toward the hydrolysis of bis-(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). We exploit this insight to perform a pH-controlled biotransformation that selectively hydrolyzes BHET to either its corresponding diacid or monoesters using both soluble and immobilized CALB. The discoveries presented here can be exploited for the valorization of BHET resulting from the organocatalytic depolymerization of PET."
439,"A global genomic analysis of 
Salmonella
 Concord reveals lineages with high antimicrobial resistance in Ethiopia","Antimicrobial resistant 
Salmonella enterica
 serovar Concord (
S
. Concord) is known to cause severe gastrointestinal and bloodstream infections in patients from Ethiopia and Ethiopian adoptees, and occasional records exist of 
S
. Concord linked to other countries. The evolution and geographical distribution of 
S
. Concord remained unclear. Here, we provide a genomic overview of the population structure and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of 
S
. Concord by analysing genomes from 284 historical and contemporary isolates obtained between 1944 and 2022 across the globe. We demonstrate that 
S
. Concord is a polyphyletic serovar distributed among three 
Salmonella
 super-lineages. Super-lineage A is composed of eight 
S
. Concord lineages, of which four are associated with multiple countries and low levels of AMR. Other lineages are restricted to Ethiopia and horizontally acquired resistance to most antimicrobials used for treating invasive 
Salmonella
 infections in low- and middle-income countries. By reconstructing complete genomes for 10 representative strains, we demonstrate the presence of AMR markers integrated in structurally diverse IncHI2 and IncA/C2 plasmids, and/or the chromosome. Molecular surveillance of pathogens such as 
S
. Concord supports the understanding of AMR and the multi-sector response to the global AMR threat. This study provides a comprehensive baseline data set essential for future molecular surveillance."
440,Pacpaint: a histology-based deep learning model uncovers the extensive intratumor molecular heterogeneity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma,"Two tumor (Classical/Basal) and stroma (Inactive/active) subtypes of Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with prognostic and theragnostic implications have been described. These molecular subtypes were defined by RNAseq, a costly technique sensitive to sample quality and cellularity, not used in routine practice. To allow rapid PDAC molecular subtyping and study PDAC heterogeneity, we develop PACpAInt, a multi-step deep learning model. PACpAInt is trained on a multicentric cohort (
n
 = 202) and validated on 4 independent cohorts including biopsies (surgical cohorts 
n
 = 148; 97; 126 / biopsy cohort 
n
 = 25), all with transcriptomic data (
n
 = 598) to predict tumor tissue, tumor cells from stroma, and their transcriptomic molecular subtypes, either at the whole slide or tile level (112 µm squares). PACpAInt correctly predicts tumor subtypes at the whole slide level on surgical and biopsies specimens and independently predicts survival. PACpAInt highlights the presence of a minor aggressive Basal contingent that negatively impacts survival in 39% of RNA-defined classical cases. Tile-level analysis ( > 6 millions) redefines PDAC microheterogeneity showing codependencies in the distribution of tumor and stroma subtypes, and demonstrates that, in addition to the Classical and Basal tumors, there are Hybrid tumors that combine the latter subtypes, and Intermediate tumors that may represent a transition state during PDAC evolution."
441,Predicting the antigenic evolution of SARS-COV-2 with deep learning,"The relentless evolution of SARS-CoV-2 poses a significant threat to public health, as it adapts to immune pressure from vaccines and natural infections. Gaining insights into potential antigenic changes is critical but challenging due to the vast sequence space. Here, we introduce the Machine Learning-guided Antigenic Evolution Prediction (MLAEP), which combines structure modeling, multi-task learning, and genetic algorithms to predict the viral fitness landscape and explore antigenic evolution via in silico directed evolution. By analyzing existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, MLAEP accurately infers variant order along antigenic evolutionary trajectories, correlating with corresponding sampling time. Our approach identified novel mutations in immunocompromised COVID-19 patients and emerging variants like XBB1.5. Additionally, MLAEP predictions were validated through in vitro neutralizing antibody binding assays, demonstrating that the predicted variants exhibited enhanced immune evasion. By profiling existing variants and predicting potential antigenic changes, MLAEP aids in vaccine development and enhances preparedness against future SARS-CoV-2 variants."
442,Machine learning optimization of candidate antibody yields highly diverse sub-nanomolar affinity antibody libraries,"Therapeutic antibodies are an important and rapidly growing drug modality. However, the design and discovery of early-stage antibody therapeutics remain a time and cost-intensive endeavor. Here we present an end-to-end Bayesian, language model-based method for designing large and diverse libraries of high-affinity single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) that are then empirically measured. In a head-to-head comparison with a directed evolution approach, we show that the best scFv generated from our method represents a 28.7-fold improvement in binding over the best scFv from the directed evolution. Additionally, 99% of designed scFvs in our most successful library are improvements over the initial candidate scFv. By comparing a library’s predicted success to actual measurements, we demonstrate our method’s ability to explore tradeoffs between library success and diversity. Results of our work highlight the significant impact machine learning models can have on scFv development. We expect our method to be broadly applicable and provide value to other protein engineering tasks."
443,Modelling genetic stability in engineered cell populations,"Predicting the evolution of engineered cell populations is a highly sought-after goal in biotechnology. While models of evolutionary dynamics are far from new, their application to synthetic systems is scarce where the vast combination of genetic parts and regulatory elements creates a unique challenge. To address this gap, we here-in present a framework that allows one to connect the DNA design of varied genetic devices with mutation spread in a growing cell population. Users can specify the functional parts of their system and the degree of mutation heterogeneity to explore, after which our model generates host-aware transition dynamics between different mutation phenotypes over time. We show how our framework can be used to generate insightful hypotheses across broad applications, from how a device’s components can be tweaked to optimise long-term protein yield and genetic shelf life, to generating new design paradigms for gene regulatory networks that improve their functionality."
444,Context-aware transcript quantification from long-read RNA-seq data with Bambu,"Most approaches to transcript quantification rely on fixed reference annotations; however, the transcriptome is dynamic and depending on the context, such static annotations contain inactive isoforms for some genes, whereas they are incomplete for others. Here we present Bambu, a method that performs machine-learning-based transcript discovery to enable quantification specific to the context of interest using long-read RNA-sequencing. To identify novel transcripts, Bambu estimates the novel discovery rate, which replaces arbitrary per-sample thresholds with a single, interpretable, precision-calibrated parameter. Bambu retains the full-length and unique read counts, enabling accurate quantification in presence of inactive isoforms. Compared to existing methods for transcript discovery, Bambu achieves greater precision without sacrificing sensitivity. We show that context-aware annotations improve quantification for both novel and known transcripts. We apply Bambu to quantify isoforms from repetitive HERVH-LTR7 retrotransposons in human embryonic stem cells, demonstrating the ability for context-specific transcript expression analysis."
445,Single cell and spatial sequencing define processes by which keratinocytes and fibroblasts amplify inflammatory responses in psoriasis,"The immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin, is incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of single cell and spatial RNA sequencing, IL-36 dependent amplification of IL-17A and TNF inflammatory responses in the absence of neutrophil proteases, which primarily occur within the supraspinous layer of the psoriatic epidermis. We further show that a subset of 
SFRP2
+
 fibroblasts in psoriasis contribute to amplification of the immune network through transition to a pro-inflammatory state. The 
SFRP2

 fibroblast communication network involves production of 
CCL13

CXCL12
, connected by ligand-receptor interactions to other spatially proximate cell types: 
CCR2

 dendritic cells, and 
CXCR4
 expressed on both CD8

 Tc17 cells and keratinocytes, respectively. The 
SFRP2

 fibroblasts also express cathepsin S, further amplifying inflammatory responses by activating IL-36G in keratinocytes. These data provide an in-depth view of psoriasis pathogenesis, which expands our understanding of the critical cellular participants to include inflammatory fibroblasts and their cellular interactions."
446,Unraveling the glycosylated immunopeptidome with HLA-Glyco,"Recent interest in targeted therapies has been sparked by the study of MHC-associated peptides (MAPs) that undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly glycosylation. In this study, we introduce a fast computational workflow that merges the MSFragger-Glyco search algorithm with a false discovery rate control for glycopeptide analysis from mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome data. By analyzing eight large-scale publicly available studies, we find that glycosylated MAPs are predominantly presented by MHC class II. Here, we present HLA-Glyco, a comprehensive resource containing over 3,400 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II N-glycopeptides from 1,049 distinct protein glycosylation sites. This resource provides valuable insights, including high levels of truncated glycans, conserved HLA-binding cores, and differences in glycosylation positional specificity between HLA allele groups. We integrate the workflow within the FragPipe computational platform and provide HLA-Glyco as a free web resource. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool and resource to aid the nascent field of glyco-immunopeptidomics."
447,Generalized precursor prediction boosts identification rates and accuracy in mass spectrometry based proteomics,"Data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has recently emerged as an important method for the identification of blood-based biomarkers. However, the large search space required to identify novel biomarkers from the plasma proteome can introduce a high rate of false positives that compromise the accuracy of false discovery rates (FDR) using existing validation methods. We developed a generalized precursor scoring (GPS) method trained on 2.75 million precursors that can confidently control FDR while increasing the number of identified proteins in DIA-MS independent of the search space. We demonstrate how GPS can generalize to new data, increase protein identification rates, and increase the overall quantitative accuracy. Finally, we apply GPS to the identification of blood-based biomarkers and identify a panel of proteins that are highly accurate in discriminating between subphenotypes of septic acute kidney injury from undepleted plasma to showcase the utility of GPS in discovery DIA-MS proteomics."
448,Transposons contribute to the acquisition of cell type-specific cis-elements in the brain,"Mammalian brains have evolved in stages over a long history to acquire higher functions. Recently, several transposable element (TE) families have been shown to evolve into cis-regulatory elements of brain-specific genes. However, it is not fully understood how TEs are important for gene regulatory networks. Here, we performed a single-cell level analysis using public data of scATAC-seq to discover TE-derived cis-elements that are important for specific cell types. Our results suggest that DNA elements derived from TEs, MER130 and MamRep434, can function as transcription factor-binding sites based on their internal motifs for Neurod2 and Lhx2, respectively, especially in glutamatergic neuronal progenitors. Furthermore, MER130- and MamRep434-derived cis-elements were amplified in the ancestors of Amniota and Eutheria, respectively. These results suggest that the acquisition of cis-elements with TEs occurred in different stages during evolution and may contribute to the acquisition of different functions or morphologies in the brain."
449,Integrative genomic analyses of promoter G-quadruplexes reveal their selective constraint and association with gene activation,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) regulate DNA replication and gene transcription, and are enriched in promoters without fully appreciated functional relevance. Here we show high selection pressure on putative G4 (pG4) forming sequences in promoters through investigating genetic and genomic data. Analyses of 76,156 whole-genome sequences reveal that G-tracts and connecting loops in promoter pG4s display lower or higher allele frequencies, respectively, than pG4-flanking regions, and central guanines (Gs) in G-tracts show higher selection pressure than other Gs. Additionally, pG4-promoters produce over 72.4% of transcripts, and promoter G4-containing genes are expressed at relatively high levels. Most genes repressed by TMPyP4, a G4-ligand, regulate epigenetic processes, and promoter G4s are enriched with gene activation histone marks, chromatin remodeler and transcription factor binding sites. Consistently, 
cis
-expression quantitative trait loci (
cis
-eQTLs) are enriched in promoter pG4s and their G-tracts. Overall, our study demonstrates selective constraint of promoter G4s and reinforces their stimulative role in gene expression."
450,Analysis and modeling of cancer drug responses using cell cycle phase-specific rate effects,"Identifying effective therapeutic treatment strategies is a major challenge to improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression, here we use genetically engineered breast cancer cell lines to track drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase to reveal drug-specific cell cycle effects that vary across time. We use a linear chain trick (LCT) computational model, which faithfully captures drug-induced dynamic responses, correctly infers drug effects, and reproduces influences on specific cell cycle phases. We use the LCT model to predict the effects of unseen drug combinations and confirm these in independent validation experiments. Our integrated experimental and modeling approach opens avenues to assess drug responses, predict effective drug combinations, and identify optimal drug sequencing strategies."
451,Discovery of senolytics using machine learning,"Cellular senescence is a stress response involved in ageing and diverse disease processes including cancer, type-2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and viral infection. Despite growing interest in targeted elimination of senescent cells, only few senolytics are known due to the lack of well-characterised molecular targets. Here, we report the discovery of three senolytics using cost-effective machine learning algorithms trained solely on published data. We computationally screened various chemical libraries and validated the senolytic action of ginkgetin, periplocin and oleandrin in human cell lines under various modalities of senescence. The compounds have potency comparable to known senolytics, and we show that oleandrin has improved potency over its target as compared to best-in-class alternatives. Our approach led to several hundred-fold reduction in drug screening costs and demonstrates that artificial intelligence can take maximum advantage of small and heterogeneous drug screening data, paving the way for new open science approaches to early-stage drug discovery."
452,Revealing proteome-level functional redundancy in the human gut microbiome using ultra-deep metaproteomics,"Functional redundancy is a key ecosystem property representing the fact that different taxa contribute to an ecosystem in similar ways through the expression of redundant functions. The redundancy of potential functions (or genome-level functional redundancy 
\({{{{{{\rm{FR}}}}}}}_{g}\)
) of human microbiomes has been recently quantified using metagenomics data. Yet, the redundancy of expressed functions in the human microbiome has never been quantitatively explored. Here, we present an approach to quantify the proteome-level functional redundancy 
\({{{{{{\rm{FR}}}}}}}_{p}\)
 in the human gut microbiome using metaproteomics. Ultra-deep metaproteomics reveals high proteome-level functional redundancy and high nestedness in the human gut proteomic content networks (i.e., the bipartite graphs connecting taxa to functions). We find that the nested topology of proteomic content networks and relatively small functional distances between proteomes of certain pairs of taxa together contribute to high 
\({{{{{{\rm{FR}}}}}}}_{p}\)
 in the human gut microbiome. As a metric comprehensively incorporating the factors of presence/absence of each function, protein abundances of each function and biomass of each taxon, 
\({{{{{{\rm{FR}}}}}}}_{p}\)
 outcompetes diversity indices in detecting significant microbiome responses to environmental factors, including individuality, biogeography, xenobiotics, and disease. We show that gut inflammation and exposure to specific xenobiotics can significantly diminish the 
\({{{{{{\rm{FR}}}}}}}_{p}\)
 with no significant change in taxonomic diversity."
453,Empowering drug off-target discovery with metabolic and structural analysis,"Elucidating intracellular drug targets is a difficult problem. While machine learning analysis of omics data has been a promising approach, going from large-scale trends to specific targets remains a challenge. Here, we develop a hierarchic workflow to focus on specific targets based on analysis of metabolomics data and growth rescue experiments. We deploy this framework to understand the intracellular molecular interactions of the multi-valent dihydrofolate reductase-targeting antibiotic compound CD15-3. We analyse global metabolomics data utilizing machine learning, metabolic modelling, and protein structural similarity to prioritize candidate drug targets. Overexpression and in vitro activity assays confirm one of the predicted candidates, HPPK (
folK
), as a CD15-3 off-target. This study demonstrates how established machine learning methods can be combined with mechanistic analyses to improve the resolution of drug target finding workflows for discovering off-targets of a metabolic inhibitor."
454,Inflationary theory of branching morphogenesis in the mouse salivary gland,"The mechanisms that regulate the patterning of branched epithelia remain a subject of long-standing debate. Recently, it has been proposed that the statistical organization of multiple ductal tissues can be explained through a local self-organizing principle based on the branching-annihilating random walk (BARW) in which proliferating tips drive a process of ductal elongation and stochastic bifurcation that terminates when tips encounter maturing ducts. Here, applied to mouse salivary gland, we show the BARW model struggles to explain the large-scale organization of tissue. Instead, we propose that the gland develops as a tip-driven branching-
delayed
 random walk (BDRW). In this framework, a generalization of the BARW, tips inhibited through steric interaction with proximate ducts may continue their branching program as constraints become alleviated through the persistent expansion of the surrounding tissue. This inflationary BDRW model presents a general paradigm for branching morphogenesis when the ductal epithelium grows cooperatively with the domain into which it expands."
455,Super-resolved trajectory-derived nanoclustering analysis using spatiotemporal indexing,"Single-molecule localization microscopy techniques are emerging as vital tools to unravel the nanoscale world of living cells by understanding the spatiotemporal organization of protein clusters at the nanometer scale. Current analyses define spatial nanoclusters based on detections but neglect important temporal information such as cluster lifetime and recurrence in “hotspots” on the plasma membrane. Spatial indexing is widely used in video games to detect interactions between moving geometric objects. Here, we use the R-tree spatial indexing algorithm to determine the overlap of the bounding boxes of individual molecular trajectories to establish membership in nanoclusters. Extending the spatial indexing into the time dimension allows the resolution of spatial nanoclusters into multiple spatiotemporal clusters. Using spatiotemporal indexing, we found that syntaxin1a and Munc18-1 molecules transiently cluster in hotspots, offering insights into the dynamics of neuroexocytosis. Nanoscale spatiotemporal indexing clustering (NASTIC) has been implemented as a free and open-source Python graphic user interface."
456,acCRISPR: an activity-correction method for improving the accuracy of CRISPR screens,"High throughput CRISPR screens are revolutionizing the way scientists unravel the genetic underpinnings of engineered and evolved phenotypes. One of the critical challenges in accurately assessing screening outcomes is accounting for the variability in sgRNA cutting efficiency. Poorly active guides targeting genes essential to screening conditions obscure the growth defects that are expected from disrupting them. Here, we develop acCRISPR, an end-to-end pipeline that identifies essential genes in pooled CRISPR screens using sgRNA read counts obtained from next-generation sequencing. acCRISPR uses experimentally determined cutting efficiencies for each guide in the library to provide an activity correction to the screening outcomes via calculation of an optimization metric, thus determining the fitness effect of disrupted genes. CRISPR-Cas9 and -Cas12a screens were carried out in the non-conventional oleaginous yeast 
Yarrowia lipolytica
 and acCRISPR was used to determine a high-confidence set of essential genes for growth under glucose, a common carbon source used for the industrial production of oleochemicals. acCRISPR was also used in screens quantifying relative cellular fitness under high salt conditions to identify genes that were related to salt tolerance. Collectively, this work presents an experimental-computational framework for CRISPR-based functional genomics studies that may be expanded to other non-conventional organisms of interest."
457,Data fusion and multivariate analysis for food authenticity analysis,"A mid-level data fusion coupled with multivariate analysis approach is applied to dual-platform mass spectrometry data sets using Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry to determine the correct classification of salmon origin and production methods. Salmon (
n
 = 522) from five different regions and two production methods are used in the study. The method achieves a cross-validation classification accuracy of 100% and all test samples (
n
 = 17) have their origins correctly determined, which is not possible with single-platform methods. Eighteen robust lipid markers and nine elemental markers are found, which provide robust evidence of the provenance of the salmon. Thus, we demonstrate that our mid-level data fusion - multivariate analysis strategy greatly improves the ability to correctly identify the geographical origin and production method of salmon, and this innovative approach can be applied to many other food authenticity applications."
458,A high-throughput test enables specific detection of hepatocellular carcinoma,"High-throughput tests for early cancer detection can revolutionize public health and reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. Here we show a DNA methylation signature for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection in liquid biopsies, distinct from normal tissues and blood profiles. We developed a classifier using four CpG sites, validated in TCGA HCC data. A single F12 gene CpG site effectively differentiates HCC samples from other blood samples, normal tissues, and non-HCC tumors in TCGA and GEO data repositories. The markers were validated in a separate plasma sample dataset from HCC patients and controls. We designed a high-throughput assay using next-generation sequencing and multiplexing techniques, analyzing plasma samples from 554 clinical study participants, including HCC patients, non-HCC cancers, chronic hepatitis B, and healthy controls. HCC detection sensitivity was 84.5% at 95% specificity and 0.94 AUC. Implementing this assay for high-risk individuals could significantly decrease HCC morbidity and mortality."
459,Chromatin alternates between A and B compartments at kilobase scale for subgenic organization,"Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF’s RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted."
460,INSurVeyor: improving insertion calling from short read sequencing data,"Insertions are one of the major types of structural variations and are defined as the addition of 50 nucleotides or more into a DNA sequence. Several methods exist to detect insertions from next-generation sequencing short read data, but they generally have low sensitivity. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce INSurVeyor, a fast, sensitive and precise method that detects insertions from next-generation sequencing paired-end data. Using publicly available benchmark datasets (both human and non-human), we show that INSurVeyor is not only more sensitive than any individual caller we tested, but also more sensitive than all of them combined. Furthermore, for most types of insertions, INSurVeyor is almost as sensitive as long reads callers. Second, we provide state-of-the-art catalogues of insertions for 1047 
Arabidopsis Thaliana
 genomes from the 1001 Genomes Project and 3202 human genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project, both generated with INSurVeyor. We show that they are more complete and precise than existing resources, and important insertions are missed by existing methods."
461,Cell-attribute aware community detection improves differential abundance testing from single-cell RNA-Seq data,"Variations of cell-type proportions within tissues could be informative of biological aging and disease risk. Single-cell RNA-sequencing offers the opportunity to detect such differential abundance patterns, yet this task can be statistically challenging due to the noise in single-cell data, inter-sample variability and because such patterns are often of small effect size. Here we present a differential abundance testing paradigm called ELVAR that uses cell attribute aware clustering when inferring differentially enriched communities within the single-cell manifold. Using simulated and real single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq datasets, we benchmark ELVAR against an analogous algorithm that uses Louvain for clustering, as well as local neighborhood-based methods, demonstrating that ELVAR improves the sensitivity to detect cell-type composition shifts in relation to aging, precancerous states and Covid-19 phenotypes. In effect, leveraging cell attribute information when inferring cell communities can denoise single-cell data, avoid the need for batch correction and help retrieve more robust cell states for subsequent differential abundance testing. ELVAR is available as an open-source R-package."
462,Functional impact and molecular binding modes of drugs that target the PI3K isoform p110δ,"Targeting the PI3K isoform p110δ against B cell malignancies is at the mainstay of PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) development. Therefore, we generated isogenic cell lines, which express wild type or mutant p110δ, for assessing the potency, isoform-selectivity and molecular interactions of various PI3Ki chemotypes. The affinity pocket mutation I777M maintains p110δ activity in the presence of idelalisib, as indicated by intracellular AKT phosphorylation, and rescues cell functions such as p110δ-dependent cell viability. Resistance owing to this substitution consistently affects the potency of p110δ-selective in contrast to most multi-targeted PI3Ki, thus distinguishing usually propeller-shaped and typically flat molecules. Accordingly, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the I777M substitution disturbs conformational flexibility in the specificity or affinity pockets of p110δ that is necessary for binding idelalisib or ZSTK474, but not copanlisib. In summary, cell-based and molecular exploration provide comparative characterization of currently developed PI3Ki and structural insights for future PI3Ki design."
463,Improvement of cryo-EM maps by simultaneous local and non-local deep learning,"Cryo-EM has emerged as the most important technique for structure determination of macromolecular complexes. However, raw cryo-EM maps often exhibit loss of contrast at high resolution and heterogeneity over the entire map. As such, various post-processing methods have been proposed to improve cryo-EM maps. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to improve both the quality and interpretability of EM maps. Addressing the challenge, we present a three-dimensional Swin-Conv-UNet-based deep learning framework to improve cryo-EM maps, named EMReady, by not only implementing both local and non-local modeling modules in a multiscale UNet architecture but also simultaneously minimizing the local smooth L1 distance and maximizing the non-local structural similarity between processed experimental and simulated target maps in the loss function. EMReady was extensively evaluated on diverse test sets of 110 primary cryo-EM maps and 25 pairs of half-maps at 3.0–6.0 Å resolutions, and compared with five state-of-the-art map post-processing methods. It is shown that EMReady can not only robustly enhance the quality of cryo-EM maps in terms of map-model correlations, but also improve the interpretability of the maps in automatic de novo model building."
464,Lociq provides a loci-seeking approach for enhanced plasmid subtyping and structural characterization,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) monitoring for public health is relying more on whole genome sequencing to characterize and compare resistant strains. This requires new approaches to describe and track AMR that take full advantage of the detailed data provided by genomic technologies. The plasmid-mediated transfer of AMR genes is a primary concern for AMR monitoring because plasmid rearrangement events can integrate new AMR genes into the plasmid backbone or promote hybridization of multiple plasmids. To better monitor plasmid evolution and dissemination, we developed the Lociq subtyping method to classify plasmids by variations in the sequence and arrangement of core plasmid genetic elements. Subtyping with Lociq provides an alpha-numeric nomenclature that can be used to denominate plasmid population diversity and characterize the relevant features of individual plasmids. Here we demonstrate how Lociq generates typing schema to track and characterize the origin, evolution and epidemiology of multidrug resistant plasmids."
465,"Transcriptomics, metabolomics
, and 
in-silico
 drug predictions for liver damage in young and aged burn victims","Burn induces a systemic response affecting multiple organs, including the liver. Since the liver plays a critical role in metabolic, inflammatory, and immune events, a patient with impaired liver often exhibits poor outcomes. The mortality rate after burns in the elderly population is higher than in any other age group, and studies show that the liver of aged animals is more susceptible to injury after burns. Understanding the aged-specific liver response to burns is fundamental to improving health care. Furthermore, no liver-specific therapy exists to treat burn-induced liver damage highlighting a critical gap in burn injury therapeutics. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomics and metabolomics data from the liver of young and aged mice to identify mechanistic pathways and in-silico predict therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse burn-induced liver damage. Our study highlights pathway interactions and master regulators that underlie the differential liver response to burn injury in young and aged animals."
466,ReX: an integrative tool for quantifying and optimizing measurement reliability for the study of individual differences,"Characterizing multifaceted individual differences in brain function using neuroimaging is central to biomarker discovery in neuroscience. We provide an integrative toolbox, Reliability eXplorer (ReX), to facilitate the examination of individual variation and reliability as well as the effective direction for optimization of measuring individual differences in biomarker discovery. We also illustrate gradient flows, a two-dimensional field map-based approach to identifying and representing the most effective direction for optimization when measuring individual differences, which is implemented in ReX."
467,Identification of a covert evolutionary pathway between two protein folds,"Although homologous protein sequences are expected to adopt similar structures, some amino acid substitutions can interconvert α-helices and β-sheets. Such fold switching may have occurred over evolutionary history, but supporting evidence has been limited by the: (1) abundance and diversity of sequenced genes, (2) quantity of experimentally determined protein structures, and (3) assumptions underlying the statistical methods used to infer homology. Here, we overcome these barriers by applying multiple statistical methods to a family of ~600,000 bacterial response regulator proteins. We find that their homologous DNA-binding subunits assume divergent structures: helix-turn-helix versus α-helix + β-sheet (winged helix). Phylogenetic analyses, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and AlphaFold2 models indicate that amino acid substitutions facilitated a switch from helix-turn-helix into winged helix. This structural transformation likely expanded DNA-binding specificity. Our approach uncovers an evolutionary pathway between two protein folds and provides a methodology to identify secondary structure switching in other protein families."
468,"No evidence of sustained nonzoonotic 
Plasmodium knowlesi
 transmission in Malaysia from modelling malaria case data","Reported incidence of the zoonotic malaria 
Plasmodium knowlesi
 has markedly increased across Southeast Asia and threatens malaria elimination. Nonzoonotic transmission of 
P. knowlesi
 has been experimentally demonstrated, but it remains unknown whether nonzoonotic transmission is contributing to increases in 
P. knowlesi
 cases. Here, we adapt model-based inference methods to estimate 
R
C
, individual case reproductive numbers, for 
P. knowlesi
, 
P. falciparum
 and 
P. vivax
 human cases in Malaysia from 2012–2020 (n = 32,635). Best fitting models for 
P. knowlesi
 showed subcritical transmission (
R
C
 < 1) consistent with a large reservoir of unobserved infection sources, indicating 
P. knowlesi
 remains a primarily zoonotic infection. In contrast, sustained transmission (
R
C
 > 1) was estimated historically for 
P. falciparum
 and 
P. vivax
, with declines in 
R
C
 estimates observed over time consistent with local elimination. Together, this suggests sustained nonzoonotic 
P. knowlesi
 transmission is highly unlikely and that new approaches are urgently needed to control spillover risks."
469,Transposon signatures of allopolyploid genome evolution,"Hybridization brings together chromosome sets from two or more distinct progenitor species. Genome duplication associated with hybridization, or allopolyploidy, allows these chromosome sets to persist as distinct subgenomes during subsequent meioses. Here, we present a general method for identifying the subgenomes of a polyploid based on shared ancestry as revealed by the genomic distribution of repetitive elements that were active in the progenitors. This subgenome-enriched transposable element signal is intrinsic to the polyploid, allowing broader applicability than other approaches that depend on the availability of sequenced diploid relatives. We develop the statistical basis of the method, demonstrate its applicability in the well-studied cases of tobacco, cotton, and 
Brassica napus
, and apply it to several cases: allotetraploid cyprinids, allohexaploid false flax, and allooctoploid strawberry. These analyses provide insight into the origins of these polyploids, revise the subgenome identities of strawberry, and provide perspective on subgenome dominance in higher polyploids."
470,Newborn metabolomic signatures of maternal per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance exposure and reduced length of gestation,"Marginalized populations experience disproportionate rates of preterm birth and early term birth. Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been reported to reduce length of gestation, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we characterized the molecular signatures of prenatal PFAS exposure and gestational age at birth outcomes in the newborn dried blood spot metabolome among 267 African American dyads in Atlanta, Georgia between 2016 and 2020. Pregnant people with higher serum perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid concentrations had increased odds of an early birth. After false discovery rate correction, the effect of prenatal PFAS exposure on reduced length of gestation was associated with 8 metabolomic pathways and 52 metabolites in newborn dried blood spots, which suggested perturbed tissue neogenesis, neuroendocrine function, and redox homeostasis. These mechanisms explain how prenatal PFAS exposure gives rise to the leading cause of infant death in the United States."
471,SIMBA: single-cell embedding along with features,"Most current single-cell analysis pipelines are limited to cell embeddings and rely heavily on clustering, while lacking the ability to explicitly model interactions between different feature types. Furthermore, these methods are tailored to specific tasks, as distinct single-cell problems are formulated differently. To address these shortcomings, here we present SIMBA, a graph embedding method that jointly embeds single cells and their defining features, such as genes, chromatin-accessible regions and DNA sequences, into a common latent space. By leveraging the co-embedding of cells and features, SIMBA allows for the study of cellular heterogeneity, clustering-free marker discovery, gene regulation inference, batch effect removal and omics data integration. We show that SIMBA provides a single framework that allows diverse single-cell problems to be formulated in a unified way and thus simplifies the development of new analyses and extension to new single-cell modalities. SIMBA is implemented as a comprehensive Python library (
https://simba-bio.readthedocs.io
)."
472,New measures of anisotropy of cryo-EM maps,"We propose two new measures of resolution anisotropy for cryogenic electron microscopy maps: Fourier shell occupancy (FSO), and the Bingham test (BT). FSO varies from 1 to 0, with 1 representing perfect isotropy, and lower values indicating increasing anisotropy. The threshold FSO = 0.5 occurs at Fourier shell correlation resolution. BT is a hypothesis test that complements the FSO to ensure the existence of anisotropy. FSO and BT allow visualization of resolution anisotropy. We illustrate their use with different experimental cryogenic electron microscopy maps."
473,ImmuneBuilder: Deep-Learning models for predicting the structures of immune proteins,"Immune receptor proteins play a key role in the immune system and have shown great promise as biotherapeutics. The structure of these proteins is critical for understanding their antigen binding properties. Here, we present ImmuneBuilder, a set of deep learning models trained to accurately predict the structure of antibodies (ABodyBuilder2), nanobodies (NanoBodyBuilder2) and T-Cell receptors (TCRBuilder2). We show that ImmuneBuilder generates structures with state of the art accuracy while being far faster than AlphaFold2. For example, on a benchmark of 34 recently solved antibodies, ABodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an RMSD of 2.81Å, a 0.09Å improvement over AlphaFold-Multimer, while being over a hundred times faster. Similar results are also achieved for nanobodies, (NanoBodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an average RMSD of 2.89Å, a 0.55Å improvement over AlphaFold2) and TCRs. By predicting an ensemble of structures, ImmuneBuilder also gives an error estimate for every residue in its final prediction. ImmuneBuilder is made freely available, both to download (
https://github.com/oxpig/ImmuneBuilder
) and to use via our webserver (
http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/newsabdab/sabpred
). We also make available structural models for ~150 thousand non-redundant paired antibody sequences (
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7258553
)."
474,Learning consistent subcellular landmarks to quantify changes in multiplexed protein maps,"Highly multiplexed imaging holds enormous promise for understanding how spatial context shapes the activity of the genome and its products at multiple length scales. Here, we introduce a deep learning framework called CAMPA (Conditional Autoencoder for Multiplexed Pixel Analysis), which uses a conditional variational autoencoder to learn representations of molecular pixel profiles that are consistent across heterogeneous cell populations and experimental perturbations. Clustering these pixel-level representations identifies consistent subcellular landmarks, which can be quantitatively compared in terms of their size, shape, molecular composition and relative spatial organization. Using high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence, this reveals how subcellular organization changes upon perturbation of RNA synthesis, RNA processing or cell size, and uncovers links between the molecular composition of membraneless organelles and cell-to-cell variability in bulk RNA synthesis rates. By capturing interpretable cellular phenotypes, we anticipate that CAMPA will greatly accelerate the systematic mapping of multiscale atlases of biological organization to identify the rules by which context shapes physiology and disease."
475,Epidemiological inference for emerging viruses using segregating sites,"Epidemiological models are commonly fit to case and pathogen sequence data to estimate parameters and to infer unobserved disease dynamics. Here, we present an inference approach based on sequence data that is well suited for model fitting early on during the expansion of a viral lineage. Our approach relies on a trajectory of segregating sites to infer epidemiological parameters within a Sequential Monte Carlo framework. Using simulated data, we first show that our approach accurately recovers key epidemiological quantities under a single-introduction scenario. We then apply our approach to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from France, estimating a basic reproduction number of approximately 2.3-2.7 under an epidemiological model that allows for multiple introductions. Our approach presented here indicates that inference approaches that rely on simple population genetic summary statistics can be informative of epidemiological parameters and can be used for reconstructing infectious disease dynamics during the early expansion of a viral lineage."
476,Inference of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks on cell lineages from single cell omic datasets,"Cell type-specific gene expression patterns are outputs of transcriptional gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that connect transcription factors and signaling proteins to target genes. Single-cell technologies such as single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), can examine cell-type specific gene regulation at unprecedented detail. However, current approaches to infer cell type-specific GRNs are limited in their ability to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements and to model network dynamics on a cell lineage. To address this challenge, we have developed single-cell Multi-Task Network Inference (scMTNI), a multi-task learning framework to infer the GRN for each cell type on a lineage from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Using simulated and real datasets, we show that scMTNI is a broadly applicable framework for linear and branching lineages that accurately infers GRN dynamics and identifies key regulators of fate transitions for diverse processes such as cellular reprogramming and differentiation."
477,Multimodal single cell analysis infers widespread enhancer co-activity in a lymphoblastoid cell line,"Non-coding regulatory elements such as enhancers are key in controlling the cell-type specificity and spatio-temporal expression of genes. To drive stable and precise gene transcription robust to genetic variation and environmental stress, genes are often targeted by multiple enhancers with redundant action. However, it is unknown whether enhancers targeting the same gene display simultaneous activity or whether some enhancer combinations are more often co-active than others. Here, we take advantage of recent developments in single cell technology that permit assessing chromatin status (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) in the same single cells to correlate gene expression to the activity of multiple enhancers. Measuring activity patterns across 24,844 human lymphoblastoid single cells, we find that the majority of enhancers associated with the same gene display significant correlation in their chromatin profiles. For 6944 expressed genes associated with enhancers, we predict 89,885 significant enhancer-enhancer associations between nearby enhancers. We find that associated enhancers share similar transcription factor binding profiles and that gene essentiality is linked with higher enhancer co-activity. We provide a set of predicted enhancer-enhancer associations based on correlation derived from a single cell line, which can be further investigated for functional relevance."
478,A computational method for cell type-specific expression quantitative trait loci mapping using bulk RNA-seq data,"Mapping cell type-specific gene expression quantitative trait loci (ct-eQTLs) is a powerful way to investigate the genetic basis of complex traits. A popular method for ct-eQTL mapping is to assess the interaction between the genotype of a genetic locus and the abundance of a specific cell type using a linear model. However, this approach requires transforming RNA-seq count data, which distorts the relation between gene expression and cell type proportions and results in reduced power and/or inflated type I error. To address this issue, we have developed a statistical method called CSeQTL that allows for ct-eQTL mapping using bulk RNA-seq count data while taking advantage of allele-specific expression. We validated the results of CSeQTL through simulations and real data analysis, comparing CSeQTL results to those obtained from purified bulk RNA-seq data or single cell RNA-seq data. Using our ct-eQTL findings, we were able to identify cell types relevant to 21 categories of human traits."
479,Wound infiltrating adipocytes are not myofibroblasts,"The origins of wound myofibroblasts and scar tissue remains unclear, but it is assumed to involve conversion of adipocytes into myofibroblasts. Here, we directly explore the potential plasticity of adipocytes and fibroblasts after skin injury. Using genetic lineage tracing and live imaging in explants and in wounded animals, we observe that injury induces a transient migratory state in adipocytes with vastly distinct cell migration patterns and behaviours from fibroblasts. Furthermore, migratory adipocytes, do not contribute to scar formation and remain non-fibrogenic in vitro, in vivo and upon transplantation into wounds in animals. Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics we confirm that wound adipocytes do not convert into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. In summary, the injury-induced migratory adipocytes remain lineage-restricted and do not converge or reprogram into a fibrosing phenotype. These findings broadly impact basic and translational strategies in the regenerative medicine field, including clinical interventions for wound repair, diabetes, and fibrotic pathologies."
480,ExpressAnalyst: A unified platform for RNA-sequencing analysis in non-model species,"The increasing application of RNA sequencing to study non-model species demands easy-to-use and efficient bioinformatics tools to help researchers quickly uncover biological and functional insights. We developed ExpressAnalyst (
www.expressanalyst.ca
), a web-based platform for processing, analyzing, and interpreting RNA-sequencing data from any eukaryotic species. ExpressAnalyst contains a series of modules that cover from processing and annotation of FASTQ files to statistical and functional analysis of count tables or gene lists. All modules are integrated with EcoOmicsDB, an ortholog database that enables comprehensive analysis for species without a reference transcriptome. By coupling ultra-fast read mapping algorithms with high-resolution ortholog databases through a user-friendly web interface, ExpressAnalyst allows researchers to obtain global expression profiles and gene-level insights from raw RNA-sequencing reads within 24 h. Here, we present ExpressAnalyst and demonstrate its utility with a case study of RNA-sequencing data from multiple non-model salamander species, including two that do not have a reference transcriptome."
481,A positive statistical benchmark to assess network agreement,"Current computational methods for validating experimental network datasets compare overlap, i.e., shared links, with a reference network using a negative benchmark. However, this fails to quantify the level of agreement between the two networks. To address this, we propose a positive statistical benchmark to determine the maximum possible overlap between networks. Our approach can efficiently generate this benchmark in a maximum entropy framework and provides a way to assess whether the observed overlap is significantly different from the best-case scenario. We introduce a normalized overlap score, Normlap, to enhance comparisons between experimental networks. As an application, we compare molecular and functional networks, resulting in an agreement network of human as well as yeast network datasets. The Normlap score can improve the comparison between experimental networks by providing a computational alternative to network thresholding and validation."
482,Computational models of episodic-like memory in food-caching birds,"Birds of the crow family adapt food-caching strategies to anticipated needs at the time of cache recovery and rely on memory of the what, where and when of previous caching events to recover their hidden food. It is unclear if this behavior can be explained by simple associative learning or if it relies on higher cognitive processes like mental time-travel. We present a computational model and propose a neural implementation of food-caching behavior. The model has hunger variables for motivational control, reward-modulated update of retrieval and caching policies and an associative neural network for remembering caching events with a memory consolidation mechanism for flexible decoding of the age of a memory. Our methodology of formalizing experimental protocols is transferable to other domains and facilitates model evaluation and experiment design. Here, we show that memory-augmented, associative reinforcement learning without mental time-travel is sufficient to explain the results of 28 behavioral experiments with food-caching birds."
483,Learning how network structure shapes decision-making for bio-inspired computing,"To better understand how network structure shapes intelligent behavior, we developed a learning algorithm that we used to build personalized brain network models for 650 Human Connectome Project participants. We found that participants with higher intelligence scores took more time to solve difficult problems, and that slower solvers had higher average functional connectivity. With simulations we identified a mechanistic link between functional connectivity, intelligence, processing speed and brain synchrony for trading accuracy with speed in dependence of excitation-inhibition balance. Reduced synchrony led decision-making circuits to quickly jump to conclusions, while higher synchrony allowed for better integration of evidence and more robust working memory. Strict tests were applied to ensure reproducibility and generality of the obtained results. Here, we identify links between brain structure and function that enable to learn connectome topology from noninvasive recordings and map it to inter-individual differences in behavior, suggesting broad utility for research and clinical applications."
484,Reference-free assembly of long-read transcriptome sequencing data with RNA-Bloom2,"Long-read sequencing technologies have improved significantly since their emergence. Their read lengths, potentially spanning entire transcripts, is advantageous for reconstructing transcriptomes. Existing long-read transcriptome assembly methods are primarily reference-based and to date, there is little focus on reference-free transcriptome assembly. We introduce “RNA-Bloom2 [
https://github.com/bcgsc/RNA-Bloom
]”, a reference-free assembly method for long-read transcriptome sequencing data. Using simulated datasets and spike-in control data, we show that the transcriptome assembly quality of RNA-Bloom2 is competitive to those of reference-based methods. Furthermore, we find that RNA-Bloom2 requires 27.0 to 80.6% of the peak memory and 3.6 to 10.8% of the total wall-clock runtime of a competing reference-free method. Finally, we showcase RNA-Bloom2 in assembling a transcriptome sample of 
Picea sitchensis
 (Sitka spruce). Since our method does not rely on a reference, it further sets the groundwork for large-scale comparative transcriptomics where high-quality draft genome assemblies are not readily available."
485,Linear time complexity de novo long read genome assembly with GoldRush,"Current state-of-the-art de novo long read genome assemblers follow the Overlap-Layout-Consensus paradigm. While read-to-read overlap – its most costly step – was improved in modern long read genome assemblers, these tools still often require excessive RAM when assembling a typical human dataset. Our work departs from this paradigm, foregoing all-vs-all sequence alignments in favor of a dynamic data structure implemented in GoldRush, a de novo long read genome assembly algorithm with linear time complexity. We tested GoldRush on Oxford Nanopore Technologies long sequencing read datasets with different base error profiles sourced from three human cell lines, rice, and tomato. Here, we show that GoldRush achieves assembly scaffold NGA50 lengths of 18.3-22.2, 0.3 and 2.6 Mbp, for the genomes of human, rice, and tomato, respectively, and assembles each genome within a day, using at most 54.5 GB of random-access memory, demonstrating the scalability of our genome assembly paradigm and its implementation."
486,Mouse microglia express unique miRNA-mRNA networks to facilitate age-specific functions in the developing central nervous system,"Microglia regulate multiple processes in the central nervous system, exhibiting a considerable level of cellular plasticity which is facilitated by an equally dynamic transcriptional environment. While many gene networks that regulate microglial functions have been characterised, the influence of epigenetic regulators such as small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) is less well defined. We have sequenced the miRNAome and mRNAome of mouse microglia during brain development and adult homeostasis, identifying unique profiles of known and novel miRNAs. Microglia express both a consistently enriched miRNA signature as well as temporally distinctive subsets of miRNAs. We generated robust miRNA-mRNA networks related to fundamental developmental processes, in addition to networks associated with immune function and dysregulated disease states. There was no apparent influence of sex on miRNA expression. This study reveals a unique developmental trajectory of miRNA expression in microglia during critical stages of CNS development, establishing miRNAs as important modulators of microglial phenotype."
487,"A method for restoring signals and revealing individual macromolecule states in cryo-ET, REST","Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is widely used to explore the 3D density of biomacromolecules. However, the heavy noise and missing wedge effect prevent directly visualizing and analyzing the 3D reconstructions. Here, we introduced REST, a deep learning strategy-based method to establish the relationship between low-quality and high-quality density and transfer the knowledge to restore signals in cryo-ET. Test results on the simulated and real cryo-ET datasets show that REST performs well in denoising and compensating the missing wedge information. The application in dynamic nucleosomes, presenting either in the form of individual particles or in the context of cryo-FIB nuclei section, indicates that REST has the capability to reveal different conformations of target macromolecules without subtomogram averaging. Moreover, REST noticeably improves the reliability of particle picking. These advantages enable REST to be a powerful tool for the straightforward interpretation of target macromolecules by visual inspection of the density and of a broad range of other applications in cryo-ET, such as segmentation, particle picking, and subtomogram averaging."
488,A scalable sparse neural network framework for rare cell type annotation of single-cell transcriptome data,"Automatic cell type annotation methods are increasingly used in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis due to their fast and precise advantages. However, current methods often fail to account for the imbalance of scRNA-seq datasets and ignore information from smaller populations, leading to significant biological analysis errors. Here, we introduce scBalance, an integrated sparse neural network framework that incorporates adaptive weight sampling and dropout techniques for auto-annotation tasks. Using 20 scRNA-seq datasets with varying scales and degrees of imbalance, we demonstrate that scBalance outperforms current methods in both intra- and inter-dataset annotation tasks. Additionally, scBalance displays impressive scalability in identifying rare cell types in million-level datasets, as shown in the bronchoalveolar cell landscape. scBalance is also significantly faster than commonly used tools and comes in a user-friendly format, making it a superior tool for scRNA-seq analysis on the Python-based platform."
489,Designed active-site library reveals thousands of functional GFP variants,"Mutations in a protein active site can lead to dramatic and useful changes in protein activity. The active site, however, is sensitive to mutations due to a high density of molecular interactions, substantially reducing the likelihood of obtaining functional multipoint mutants. We introduce an atomistic and machine-learning-based approach, called high-throughput Functional Libraries (htFuncLib), that designs a sequence space in which mutations form low-energy combinations that mitigate the risk of incompatible interactions. We apply htFuncLib to the GFP chromophore-binding pocket, and, using fluorescence readout, recover >16,000 unique designs encoding as many as eight active-site mutations. Many designs exhibit substantial and useful diversity in functional thermostability (up to 96 °C), fluorescence lifetime, and quantum yield. By eliminating incompatible active-site mutations, htFuncLib generates a large diversity of functional sequences. We envision that htFuncLib will be used in one-shot optimization of activity in enzymes, binders, and other proteins."
490,Computational design of dynamic receptor—peptide signaling complexes applied to chemotaxis,"Engineering protein biosensors that sensitively respond to specific biomolecules by triggering precise cellular responses is a major goal of diagnostics and synthetic cell biology. Previous biosensor designs have largely relied on binding structurally well-defined molecules. In contrast, approaches that couple the sensing of flexible compounds to intended cellular responses would greatly expand potential biosensor applications. Here, to address these challenges, we develop a computational strategy for designing signaling complexes between conformationally dynamic proteins and peptides. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we create ultrasensitive chemotactic receptor—peptide pairs capable of eliciting potent signaling responses and strong chemotaxis in primary human T cells. Unlike traditional approaches that engineer static binding complexes, our dynamic structure design strategy optimizes contacts with multiple binding and allosteric sites accessible through dynamic conformational ensembles to achieve strongly enhanced signaling efficacy and potency. Our study suggests that a conformationally adaptable binding interface coupled to a robust allosteric transmission region is a key evolutionary determinant of peptidergic GPCR signaling systems. The approach lays a foundation for designing peptide-sensing receptors and signaling peptide ligands for basic and therapeutic applications."
491,SVSBI: sequence-based virtual screening of biomolecular interactions,"Virtual screening (VS) is a critical technique in understanding biomolecular interactions, particularly in drug design and discovery. However, the accuracy of current VS models heavily relies on three-dimensional (3D) structures obtained through molecular docking, which is often unreliable due to the low accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a sequence-based virtual screening (SVS) as another generation of VS models that utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and optimized deep 
K
-embedding strategies to encode biomolecular interactions without relying on 3D structure-based docking. We demonstrate that SVS outperforms state-of-the-art performance for four regression datasets involving protein-ligand binding, protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid binding, and ligand inhibition of protein-protein interactions and five classification datasets for protein-protein interactions in five biological species. SVS has the potential to transform current practices in drug discovery and protein engineering."
492,The Cell Tracking Challenge: 10 years of objective benchmarking,"The Cell Tracking Challenge is an ongoing benchmarking initiative that has become a reference in cell segmentation and tracking algorithm development. Here, we present a significant number of improvements introduced in the challenge since our 2017 report. These include the creation of a new segmentation-only benchmark, the enrichment of the dataset repository with new datasets that increase its diversity and complexity, and the creation of a silver standard reference corpus based on the most competitive results, which will be of particular interest for data-hungry deep learning-based strategies. Furthermore, we present the up-to-date cell segmentation and tracking leaderboards, an in-depth analysis of the relationship between the performance of the state-of-the-art methods and the properties of the datasets and annotations, and two novel, insightful studies about the generalizability and the reusability of top-performing methods. These studies provide critical practical conclusions for both developers and users of traditional and machine learning-based cell segmentation and tracking algorithms."
493,Enabling accurate and early detection of recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wastewater,"As clinical testing declines, wastewater monitoring can provide crucial surveillance on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concerns (VoCs) in communities. In this paper we present QuaID, a novel bioinformatics tool for VoC detection based on quasi-unique mutations. The benefits of QuaID are three-fold: (i) provides up to 3-week earlier VoC detection, (ii) accurate VoC detection (>95% precision on simulated benchmarks), and (iii) leverages all mutational signatures (including insertions & deletions)."
494,A randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of automated medication-targeted alerts on acute kidney injury outcomes,"Acute kidney injury is common among hospitalized individuals, particularly those exposed to certain medications, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In a pragmatic, open-label, National Institutes of Health-funded, parallel group randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02771977), we investigate whether an automated clinical decision support system affects discontinuation rates of potentially nephrotoxic medications and improves outcomes in patients with AKI. Participants included 5060 hospitalized adults with AKI and an active order for any of three classes of medications of interest: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, or proton pump inhibitors. Within 24 hours of randomization, a medication of interest was discontinued in 61.1% of the alert group versus 55.9% of the usual care group (relative risk 1.08, 1.04 – 1.14, p = 0.0003). The primary outcome – a composite of progression of acute kidney injury, dialysis, or death within 14 days - occurred in 585 (23.1%) of individuals in the alert group and 639 (25.3%) of patients in the usual care group (RR 0.92, 0.83 – 1.01, p = 0.09). Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02771977."
495,Fine-mapping of retinal vascular complexity loci identifies Notch regulation as a shared mechanism with myocardial infarction outcomes,"There is increasing evidence that the complexity of the retinal vasculature measured as fractal dimension, D
f
, might offer earlier insights into the progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) before traditional biomarkers can be detected. This association could be partly explained by a common genetic basis; however, the genetic component of D
f
 is poorly understood. We present a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 38,000 individuals with white British ancestry from the UK Biobank aimed to comprehensively study the genetic component of D
f
 and analyse its relationship with CAD. We replicated 5 D
f
 loci and found 4 additional loci with suggestive significance (
P
 < 1e−05) to contribute to D
f
 variation, which previously were reported in retinal tortuosity and complexity, hypertension, and CAD studies. Significant negative genetic correlation estimates support the inverse relationship between D
f
 and CAD, and between D
f
 and myocardial infarction (MI), one of CAD’s fatal outcomes. Fine-mapping of D
f
 loci revealed Notch signalling regulatory variants supporting a shared mechanism with MI outcomes. We developed a predictive model for MI incident cases, recorded over a 10-year period following clinical and ophthalmic evaluation, combining clinical information, D
f
, and a CAD polygenic risk score. Internal cross-validation demonstrated a considerable improvement in the area under the curve (AUC) of our predictive model (AUC = 0.770 ± 0.001) when comparing with an established risk model, SCORE, (AUC = 0.741 ± 0.002) and extensions thereof leveraging the PRS (AUC = 0.728 ± 0.001). This evidences that D
f
 provides risk information beyond demographic, lifestyle, and genetic risk factors. Our findings shed new light on the genetic basis of D
f
, unveiling a common control with MI, and highlighting the benefits of its application in individualised MI risk prediction."
496,A general model to predict small molecule substrates of enzymes based on machine and deep learning,"For most proteins annotated as enzymes, it is unknown which primary and/or secondary reactions they catalyze. Experimental characterizations of potential substrates are time-consuming and costly. Machine learning predictions could provide an efficient alternative, but are hampered by a lack of information regarding enzyme non-substrates, as available training data comprises mainly positive examples. Here, we present ESP, a general machine-learning model for the prediction of enzyme-substrate pairs with an accuracy of over 91% on independent and diverse test data. ESP can be applied successfully across widely different enzymes and a broad range of metabolites included in the training data, outperforming models designed for individual, well-studied enzyme families. ESP represents enzymes through a modified transformer model, and is trained on data augmented with randomly sampled small molecules assigned as non-substrates. By facilitating easy in silico testing of potential substrates, the ESP web server may support both basic and applied science."
497,Multi-omics delineation of cytokine-induced endothelial inflammatory states,"Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) form a dynamic interface between blood and tissue and play a crucial role in the progression of vascular inflammation. Here, we aim to dissect the system-wide molecular mechanisms of inflammatory endothelial-cytokine responses. Applying an unbiased cytokine library, we determined that TNFα and IFNγ induced the largest EC response resulting in distinct proteomic inflammatory signatures. Notably, combined TNFα + IFNγ stimulation induced an additional synergetic inflammatory signature. We employed a multi-omics approach to dissect these inflammatory states, combining (phospho-) proteome, transcriptome and secretome and found, depending on the stimulus, a wide-array of altered immune-modulating processes, including complement proteins, MHC complexes and distinct secretory cytokines. Synergy resulted in cooperative activation of transcript induction. This resource describes the intricate molecular mechanisms that are at the basis of endothelial inflammation and supports the adaptive immunomodulatory role of the endothelium in host defense and vascular inflammation."
498,TomoTwin: generalized 3D localization of macromolecules in cryo-electron tomograms with structural data mining,"Cryogenic-electron tomography enables the visualization of cellular environments in extreme detail, however, tools to analyze the full amount of information contained within these densely packed volumes are still needed. Detailed analysis of macromolecules through subtomogram averaging requires particles to first be localized within the tomogram volume, a task complicated by several factors including a low signal to noise ratio and crowding of the cellular space. Available methods for this task suffer either from being error prone or requiring manual annotation of training data. To assist in this crucial particle picking step, we present TomoTwin: an open source general picking model for cryogenic-electron tomograms based on deep metric learning. By embedding tomograms in an information-rich, high-dimensional space that separates macromolecules according to their three-dimensional structure, TomoTwin allows users to identify proteins in tomograms de novo without manually creating training data or retraining the network to locate new proteins."
499,Spatial analysis with SPIAT and spaSim to characterize and simulate tissue microenvironments,"Spatial proteomics technologies have revealed an underappreciated link between the location of cells in tissue microenvironments and the underlying biology and clinical features, but there is significant lag in the development of downstream analysis methods and benchmarking tools. Here we present SPIAT (spatial image analysis of tissues), a spatial-platform agnostic toolkit with a suite of spatial analysis algorithms, and spaSim (spatial simulator), a simulator of tissue spatial data. SPIAT includes multiple colocalization, neighborhood and spatial heterogeneity metrics to characterize the spatial patterns of cells. Ten spatial metrics of SPIAT are benchmarked using simulated data generated with spaSim. We show how SPIAT can uncover cancer immune subtypes correlated with prognosis in cancer and characterize cell dysfunction in diabetes. Our results suggest SPIAT and spaSim as useful tools for quantifying spatial patterns, identifying and validating correlates of clinical outcomes and supporting method development."
500,"Blood-feeding adaptations and virome assessment of the poultry red mite 
Dermanyssus gallinae
 guided by RNA-seq","Dermanyssus gallinae
 is a blood-feeding mite that parasitises wild birds and farmed poultry. Its remarkably swift processing of blood, together with the capacity to blood-feed during most developmental stages, makes this mite a highly debilitating pest. To identify specific adaptations to digestion of a haemoglobin-rich diet, we constructed and compared transcriptomes from starved and blood-fed stages of the parasite and identified midgut-enriched transcripts. We noted that midgut transcripts encoding cysteine proteases were upregulated with a blood meal. Mapping the full proteolytic apparatus, we noted a reduction in the suite of cysteine proteases, missing homologues for Cathepsin B and C. We have further identified and phylogenetically analysed three distinct transcripts encoding vitellogenins that facilitate the reproductive capacity of the mites. We also fully mapped transcripts for haem biosynthesis and the ferritin-based system of iron storage and inter-tissue trafficking. Additionally, we identified transcripts encoding proteins implicated in immune signalling (Toll and IMD pathways) and activity (defensins and thioester-containing proteins), RNAi, and ion channelling (with targets for commercial acaricides such as Fluralaner, Fipronil, and Ivermectin). Viral sequences were filtered from the Illumina reads and we described, in part, the RNA-virome of 
D. gallinae
 with identification of a novel virus, Red mite quaranjavirus 1."
501,A computationally designed ACE2 decoy has broad efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants and related viruses in vitro and in vivo,"SARS-CoV-2, especially B.1.1.529/omicron and its sublineages, continues to mutate to evade monoclonal antibodies and antibodies elicited by vaccination. Affinity-enhanced soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is an alternative strategy that works by binding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, acting as a ‘decoy’ to block the interaction between the S and human ACE2. Using a computational design strategy, we designed an affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoy, 
FLIF
, that exhibited tight binding to SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants. Our computationally calculated absolute binding free energies (ABFE) between sACE2:SARS-CoV-2 S proteins and their variants showed excellent agreement to binding experiments. 
FLIF
 displayed robust therapeutic utility against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses, and neutralized omicron BA.5 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we directly compared the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of wild-type ACE2 (non-affinity enhanced ACE2) against 
FLIF
. A few wild-type sACE2 decoys have shown to be effective against early circulating variants such as Wuhan in vivo. Our data suggest that moving forward, affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoys like 
FLIF
 may be required to combat evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. The approach described herein emphasizes how computational methods have become sufficiently accurate for the design of therapeutics against viral protein targets. Affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoys remain highly effective at neutralizing omicron subvariants."
502,"Modelling the impact of interventions on imported, introduced and indigenous malaria infections in Zanzibar, Tanzania","Malaria cases can be classified as imported, introduced or indigenous cases. The World Health Organization’s definition of malaria elimination requires an area to demonstrate that no new indigenous cases have occurred in the last three years. Here, we present a stochastic metapopulation model of malaria transmission that distinguishes between imported, introduced and indigenous cases, and can be used to test the impact of new interventions in a setting with low transmission and ongoing case importation. We use human movement and malaria prevalence data from Zanzibar, Tanzania, to parameterise the model. We test increasing the coverage of interventions such as reactive case detection; implementing new interventions including reactive drug administration and treatment of infected travellers; and consider the potential impact of a reduction in transmission on Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. We find that the majority of new cases on both major islands of Zanzibar are indigenous cases, despite high case importation rates. Combinations of interventions that increase the number of infections treated through reactive case detection or reactive drug administration can lead to substantial decreases in malaria incidence, but for elimination within the next 40 years, transmission reduction in both Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania is necessary."
503,Cross-modality supervised image restoration enables nanoscale tracking of synaptic plasticity in living mice,"Learning is thought to involve changes in glutamate receptors at synapses, submicron structures that mediate communication between neurons in the central nervous system. Due to their small size and high density, synapses are difficult to resolve in vivo, limiting our ability to directly relate receptor dynamics to animal behavior. Here we developed a combination of computational and biological methods to overcome these challenges. First, we trained a deep-learning image-restoration algorithm that combines the advantages of ex vivo super-resolution and in vivo imaging modalities to overcome limitations specific to each optical system. When applied to in vivo images from transgenic mice expressing fluorescently labeled glutamate receptors, this restoration algorithm super-resolved synapses, enabling the tracking of behavior-associated synaptic plasticity with high spatial resolution. This method demonstrates the capabilities of image enhancement to learn from ex vivo data and imaging techniques to improve in vivo imaging resolution."
504,3DFlex: determining structure and motion of flexible proteins from cryo-EM,"Modeling flexible macromolecules is one of the foremost challenges in single-particle cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), with the potential to illuminate fundamental questions in structural biology. We introduce Three-Dimensional Flexible Refinement (3DFlex), a motion-based neural network model for continuous molecular heterogeneity for cryo-EM data. 3DFlex exploits knowledge that conformational variability of a protein is often the result of physical processes that transport density over space and tend to preserve local geometry. From two-dimensional image data, 3DFlex enables the determination of high-resolution 3D density, and provides an explicit model of a flexible protein’s motion over its conformational landscape. Experimentally, for large molecular machines (tri-snRNP spliceosome complex, translocating ribosome) and small flexible proteins (TRPV1 ion channel, 
α
V
β
8 integrin, SARS-CoV-2 spike), 3DFlex learns nonrigid molecular motions while resolving details of moving secondary structure elements. 3DFlex can improve 3D density resolution beyond the limits of existing methods because particle images contribute coherent signal over the conformational landscape."
505,Metal3D: a general deep learning framework for accurate metal ion location prediction in proteins,"Metal ions are essential cofactors for many proteins and play a crucial role in many applications such as enzyme design or design of protein-protein interactions because they are biologically abundant, tether to the protein using strong interactions, and have favorable catalytic properties. Computational design of metalloproteins is however hampered by the complex electronic structure of many biologically relevant metals such as zinc . In this work, we develop two tools - Metal3D (based on 3D convolutional neural networks) and Metal1D (solely based on geometric criteria) to improve the location prediction of zinc ions in protein structures. Comparison with other currently available tools shows that Metal3D is the most accurate zinc ion location predictor to date with predictions within 0.70 ± 0.64 Å of experimental locations. Metal3D outputs a confidence metric for each predicted site and works on proteins with few homologes in the protein data bank. Metal3D predicts a global zinc density that can be used for annotation of computationally predicted structures and a per residue zinc density that can be used in protein design workflows. Currently trained on zinc, the framework of Metal3D is readily extensible to other metals by modifying the training data."
506,Alternative promoters in CpG depleted regions are prevalently associated with epigenetic misregulation of liver cancer transcriptomes,"Transcriptional regulation is commonly governed by alternative promoters. However, the regulatory architecture in alternative and reference promoters, and how they differ, remains elusive. In 100 CAGE-seq libraries from hepatocellular carcinoma patients, here we annotate 4083 alternative promoters in 2926 multi-promoter genes, which are largely undetected in normal livers. These genes are enriched in oncogenic processes and predominantly show association with overall survival. Alternative promoters are narrow nucleosome depleted regions, CpG island depleted, and enriched for tissue-specific transcription factors. Globally tumors lose DNA methylation. We show hierarchical retention of intragenic DNA methylation with CG-poor regions rapidly losing methylation, while CG-rich regions retain it, a process mediated by differential 
SETD2
, H3K36me3, 
DNMT3B
, and 
TET1
 binding. This mechanism is validated in 
SETD2
 knockdown cells and 
SETD2
-mutated patients. Selective DNA methylation loss in CG-poor regions makes the chromatin accessible for alternative transcription. We show alternative promoters can control tumor transcriptomes and their regulatory architecture."
507,The PECAn image and statistical analysis pipeline identifies Minute cell competition genes and features,"Investigating organ biology often requires methodologies to induce genetically distinct clones within a living tissue. However, the 3D nature of clones makes sample image analysis challenging and slow, limiting the amount of information that can be extracted manually. Here we develop PECAn, a pipeline for image processing and statistical data analysis of complex multi-genotype 3D images. PECAn includes data handling, machine-learning-enabled segmentation, multivariant statistical analysis, and graph generation. This enables researchers to perform rigorous analyses rapidly and at scale, without requiring programming skills. We demonstrate the power of this pipeline by applying it to the study of Minute cell competition. We find an unappreciated sexual dimorphism in Minute cell growth in competing wing discs and identify, by statistical regression analysis, tissue parameters that model and correlate with competitive death. Furthermore, using PECAn, we identify several genes with a role in cell competition by conducting an RNAi-based screen."
508,Skin basal cell carcinomas assemble a pro-tumorigenic spatially organized and self-propagating Trem2+ myeloid niche,"Cancer immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment but have shown limited success as single-agent therapies highlighting the need to understand the origin, assembly, and dynamics of heterogeneous tumor immune niches. Here, we use single-cell and imaging-based spatial analysis to elucidate three microenvironmental neighborhoods surrounding the heterogeneous basal cell carcinoma tumor epithelia. Within the highly proliferative neighborhood, we find that TREM2
+
 skin cancer-associated macrophages (SCAMs) support the proliferation of a distinct tumor epithelial population through an immunosuppression-independent manner via oncostatin-M/JAK-STAT3 signaling. SCAMs represent a unique tumor-specific TREM2
+
 population defined by VCAM1 surface expression that is not found in normal homeostatic skin or during wound healing. Furthermore, SCAMs actively proliferate and self-propagate through multiple serial tumor passages, indicating long-term potential. The tumor rapidly drives SCAM differentiation, with intratumoral injections sufficient to instruct naive bone marrow-derived monocytes to polarize within days. This work provides mechanistic insights into direct tumor-immune niche dynamics independent of immunosuppression, providing the basis for potential combination tumor therapies."
509,Candida expansion in the gut of lung cancer patients associates with an ecological signature that supports growth under dysbiotic conditions,"Candida
 species overgrowth in the human gut is considered a prerequisite for invasive candidiasis, but our understanding of gut bacteria promoting or restricting this overgrowth is still limited. By integrating cross-sectional mycobiome and shotgun metagenomics data from the stool of 75 male and female cancer patients at risk but without systemic candidiasis, bacterial communities in high 
Candida
 samples display higher metabolic flexibility yet lower contributional diversity than those in low 
Candida
 samples. We develop machine learning models that use only bacterial taxa or functional relative abundances to predict the levels of 
Candida
 genus and species in an external validation cohort with an AUC of 78.6–81.1%. We propose a mechanism for intestinal 
Candida
 overgrowth based on an increase in lactate-producing bacteria, which coincides with a decrease in bacteria that regulate short chain fatty acid and oxygen levels. Under these conditions, the ability of 
Candida
 to harness lactate as a nutrient source may enable 
Candida
 to outcompete other fungi in the gut."
510,EmbryoNet: using deep learning to link embryonic phenotypes to signaling pathways,"Evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways are essential for early embryogenesis, and reducing or abolishing their activity leads to characteristic developmental defects. Classification of phenotypic defects can identify the underlying signaling mechanisms, but this requires expert knowledge and the classification schemes have not been standardized. Here we use a machine learning approach for automated phenotyping to train a deep convolutional neural network, EmbryoNet, to accurately identify zebrafish signaling mutants in an unbiased manner. Combined with a model of time-dependent developmental trajectories, this approach identifies and classifies with high precision phenotypic defects caused by loss of function of the seven major signaling pathways relevant for vertebrate development. Our classification algorithms have wide applications in developmental biology and robustly identify signaling defects in evolutionarily distant species. Furthermore, using automated phenotyping in high-throughput drug screens, we show that EmbryoNet can resolve the mechanism of action of pharmaceutical substances. As part of this work, we freely provide more than 2 million images that were used to train and test EmbryoNet."
511,Cell-selective proteomics segregates pancreatic cancer subtypes by extracellular proteins in tumors and circulation,"Cell-selective proteomics is a powerful emerging concept to study heterocellular processes in tissues. However, its high potential to identify non-cell-autonomous disease mechanisms and biomarkers has been hindered by low proteome coverage. Here, we address this limitation and devise a comprehensive azidonorleucine labeling, click chemistry enrichment, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics and secretomics strategy to dissect aberrant signals in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our in-depth co-culture and in vivo analyses cover more than 10,000 cancer cell-derived proteins and reveal systematic differences between molecular PDAC subtypes. Secreted proteins, such as chemokines and EMT-promoting matrisome proteins, associated with distinct macrophage polarization and tumor stromal composition, differentiate classical and mesenchymal PDAC. Intriguingly, more than 1,600 cancer cell-derived proteins including cytokines and pre-metastatic niche formation-associated factors in mouse serum reflect tumor activity in circulation. Our findings highlight how cell-selective proteomics can accelerate the discovery of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in cancer."
512,Improving de novo protein binder design with deep learning,"Recently it has become possible to de novo design high affinity protein binding proteins from target structural information alone. There is, however, considerable room for improvement as the overall design success rate is low. Here, we explore the augmentation of energy-based protein binder design using deep learning. We find that using AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold to assess the probability that a designed sequence adopts the designed monomer structure, and the probability that this structure binds the target as designed, increases design success rates nearly 10-fold. We find further that sequence design using ProteinMPNN rather than Rosetta considerably increases computational efficiency."
513,MetaTiME integrates single-cell gene expression to characterize the meta-components of the tumor immune microenvironment,"Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have shown heterogeneous cell types and gene expression states in the non-cancerous cells in tumors. The integration of multiple scRNA-seq datasets across tumors can indicate common cell types and states in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We develop a data driven framework, MetaTiME, to overcome the limitations in resolution and consistency that result from manual labelling using known gene markers. Using millions of TME single cells, MetaTiME learns meta-components that encode independent components of gene expression observed across cancer types. The meta-components are biologically interpretable as cell types, cell states, and signaling activities. By projecting onto the MetaTiME space, we provide a tool to annotate cell states and signature continuums for TME scRNA-seq data. Leveraging epigenetics data, MetaTiME reveals critical transcriptional regulators for the cell states. Overall, MetaTiME learns data-driven meta-components that depict cellular states and gene regulators for tumor immunity and cancer immunotherapy."
514,Optimal enzyme utilization suggests that concentrations and thermodynamics determine binding mechanisms and enzyme saturations,"Deciphering the metabolic functions of organisms requires understanding the dynamic responses of living cells upon genetic and environmental perturbations, which in turn can be inferred from enzymatic activity. In this work, we investigate the optimal modes of operation for enzymes in terms of the evolutionary pressure driving them toward increased catalytic efficiency. We develop a framework using a mixed-integer formulation to assess the distribution of thermodynamic forces and enzyme states, providing detailed insights into the enzymatic mode of operation. We use this framework to explore Michaelis-Menten and random-ordered multi-substrate mechanisms. We show that optimal enzyme utilization is achieved by unique or alternative operating modes dependent on reactant concentrations. We find that in a bimolecular enzyme reaction, the random mechanism is optimal over any other ordered mechanism under physiological conditions. Our framework can investigate the optimal catalytic properties of complex enzyme mechanisms. It can further guide the directed evolution of enzymes and fill in the knowledge gaps in enzyme kinetics."
515,Single-cell subcellular protein localisation using novel ensembles of diverse deep architectures,"Unravelling protein distributions within individual cells is vital to understanding their function and state and indispensable to developing new treatments. Here we present the Hybrid subCellular Protein Localiser (HCPL), which learns from weakly labelled data to robustly localise single-cell subcellular protein patterns. It comprises innovative DNN architectures exploiting wavelet filters and learnt parametric activations that successfully tackle drastic cell variability. HCPL features correlation-based ensembling of novel architectures that boosts performance and aids generalisation. Large-scale data annotation is made feasible by our AI-trains-AI approach, which determines the visual integrity of cells and emphasises reliable labels for efficient training. In the Human Protein Atlas context, we demonstrate that HCPL is best performing in the single-cell classification of protein localisation patterns. To better understand the inner workings of HCPL and assess its biological relevance, we analyse the contributions of each system component and dissect the emergent features from which the localisation predictions are derived."
516,CapsNet-MHC predicts peptide-MHC class I binding based on capsule neural networks,"The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binds to the derived peptides from pathogens to present them to killer T cells on the cell surface. Developing computational methods for accurate, fast, and explainable peptide-MHC binding prediction can facilitate immunotherapies and vaccine development. Various deep learning-based methods rely on separate feature extraction from the peptide and MHC sequences and ignore their pairwise binding information. This paper develops a capsule neural network-based method to efficiently capture the peptide-MHC complex features to predict the peptide-MHC class I binding. Various evaluations confirmed our method outperformance over the alternative methods, while it can provide accurate prediction over less available data. Moreover, for providing precise insights into the results, we explored the essential features that contributed to the prediction. Since the simulation results demonstrated consistency with the experimental studies, we concluded that our method can be utilized for the accurate, rapid, and interpretable peptide-MHC binding prediction to assist biological therapies."
517,Molecular determinants of inhibition of UCP1-mediated respiratory uncoupling,"Brown adipose tissue expresses uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which dissipates energy as heat, making it a target for treating metabolic disorders. Here, we investigate how purine nucleotides inhibit respiration uncoupling by UCP1. Our molecular simulations predict that GDP and GTP bind UCP1 in the common substrate binding site in an upright orientation, where the base moiety interacts with conserved residues R92 and E191. We identify a triplet of uncharged residues, F88/I187/W281, forming hydrophobic contacts with nucleotides. In yeast spheroplast respiration assays, both I187A and W281A mutants increase the fatty acid-induced uncoupling activity of UCP1 and partially suppress the inhibition of UCP1 activity by nucleotides. The F88A/I187A/W281A triple mutant is overactivated by fatty acids even at high concentrations of purine nucleotides. In simulations, E191 and W281 interact with purine but not pyrimidine bases. These results provide a molecular understanding of the selective inhibition of UCP1 by purine nucleotides."
518,NetBID2 provides comprehensive hidden driver analysis,"Many signaling and other genes known as “hidden” drivers may not be genetically or epigenetically altered or differentially expressed at the mRNA or protein levels, but, rather, drive a phenotype such as tumorigenesis via post-translational modification or other mechanisms. However, conventional approaches based on genomics or differential expression are limited in exposing such hidden drivers. Here, we present a comprehensive algorithm and toolkit NetBID2 (data-driven network-based Bayesian inference of drivers, version 2), which reverse-engineers context-specific interactomes and integrates network activity inferred from large-scale multi-omics data, empowering the identification of hidden drivers that could not be detected by traditional analyses. NetBID2 has substantially re-engineered the previous prototype version by providing versatile data visualization and sophisticated statistical analyses, which strongly facilitate researchers for result interpretation through end-to-end multi-omics data analysis. We demonstrate the power of NetBID2 using three hidden driver examples. We deploy NetBID2 Viewer, Runner, and Cloud apps with 145 context-specific gene regulatory and signaling networks across normal tissues and paediatric and adult cancers to facilitate end-to-end analysis, real-time interactive visualization and cloud-based data sharing.

519,Chemistry-intuitive explanation of graph neural networks for molecular property prediction with substructure masking,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in molecular property prediction, but explaining their black-box predictions is still a challenge. Most existing explanation methods for GNNs in chemistry focus on attributing model predictions to individual nodes, edges or fragments that are not necessarily derived from a chemically meaningful segmentation of molecules. To address this challenge, we propose a method named substructure mask explanation (SME). SME is based on well-established molecular segmentation methods and provides an interpretation that aligns with the understanding of chemists. We apply SME to elucidate how GNNs learn to predict aqueous solubility, genotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and blood–brain barrier permeation for small molecules. SME provides interpretation that is consistent with the understanding of chemists, alerts them to unreliable performance, and guides them in structural optimization for target properties. Hence, we believe that SME empowers chemists to confidently mine structure-activity relationship (SAR) from reliable GNNs through a transparent inspection on how GNNs pick up useful signals when learning from data."
520,Privacy risks of whole-slide image sharing in digital pathology,"Access to large volumes of so-called whole-slide images—high-resolution scans of complete pathological slides—has become a cornerstone of the development of novel artificial intelligence methods in pathology for diagnostic use, education/training of pathologists, and research. Nevertheless, a methodology based on risk analysis for evaluating the privacy risks associated with sharing such imaging data and applying the principle “as open as possible and as closed as necessary” is still lacking. In this article, we develop a model for privacy risk analysis for whole-slide images which focuses primarily on identity disclosure attacks, as these are the most important from a regulatory perspective. We introduce a taxonomy of whole-slide images with respect to privacy risks and mathematical model for risk assessment and design . Based on this risk assessment model and the taxonomy, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the risks using real-world imaging data. Finally, we develop guidelines for risk assessment and recommendations for low-risk sharing of whole-slide image data."
521,Genomic mutation landscape of skin cancers from DNA repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum patients,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway (groups A-G) or in Translesion Synthesis DNA polymerase η (V). XP is associated with an increased skin cancer risk, reaching, for some groups, several thousand-fold compared to the general population. Here, we analyze 38 skin cancer genomes from five XP groups. We find that the activity of NER determines heterogeneity of the mutation rates across skin cancer genomes and that transcription-coupled NER extends beyond the gene boundaries reducing the intergenic mutation rate. Mutational profile in XP-V tumors and experiments with 
POLH
 knockout cell line reveal the role of polymerase η in the error-free bypass of (i) rare TpG and TpA DNA lesions, (ii) 3’ nucleotides in pyrimidine dimers, and (iii) TpT photodimers. Our study unravels the genetic basis of skin cancer risk in XP and provides insights into the mechanisms reducing UV-induced mutagenesis in the general population."
522,Explainable multi-task learning for multi-modality biological data analysis,"Current biotechnologies can simultaneously measure multiple high-dimensional modalities (e.g., RNA, DNA accessibility, and protein) from the same cells. A combination of different analytical tasks (e.g., multi-modal integration and cross-modal analysis) is required to comprehensively understand such data, inferring how gene regulation drives biological diversity and functions. However, current analytical methods are designed to perform a single task, only providing a partial picture of the multi-modal data. Here, we present UnitedNet, an explainable multi-task deep neural network capable of integrating different tasks to analyze single-cell multi-modality data. Applied to various multi-modality datasets (e.g., Patch-seq, multiome ATAC + gene expression, and spatial transcriptomics), UnitedNet demonstrates similar or better accuracy in multi-modal integration and cross-modal prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, by dissecting the trained UnitedNet with the explainable machine learning algorithm, we can directly quantify the relationship between gene expression and other modalities with cell-type specificity. UnitedNet is a comprehensive end-to-end framework that could be broadly applicable to single-cell multi-modality biology. This framework has the potential to facilitate the discovery of cell-type-specific regulation kinetics across transcriptomics and other modalities."
523,A blueprint for a synthetic genetic feedback optimizer,"Biomolecular control enables leveraging cells as biomanufacturing factories. Despite recent advancements, we currently lack genetically encoded modules that can be deployed to dynamically fine-tune and optimize cellular performance. Here, we address this shortcoming by presenting the blueprint of a genetic feedback module to optimize a broadly defined performance metric by adjusting the production and decay rate of a (set of) regulator species. We demonstrate that the optimizer can be implemented by combining available synthetic biology parts and components, and that it can be readily integrated with existing pathways and genetically encoded biosensors to ensure its successful deployment in a variety of settings. We further illustrate that the optimizer successfully locates and tracks the optimum in diverse contexts when relying on mass action kinetics-based dynamics and parameter values typical in 
Escherichia coli

524,Identification of CircRNA signature associated with tumor immune infiltration to predict therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of cancer. However, the clinical implications and regulatory networks of circRNAs in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint blockades (ICB) have not been fully elucidated. Here, we characterize circRNA expression profiles in two independent cohorts of 157 ICB-treated advanced melanoma patients and reveal overall overexpression of circRNAs in ICB non-responders in both pre-treatment and early during therapy. Then, we construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks to reveal circRNA-related signaling pathways in the context of ICB treatment. Further, we construct an ICB-related circRNA signature (ICBcircSig) score model based on progression-free survival-related circRNAs to predict immunotherapy efficacy. Mechanistically, the overexpression of ICBcircSig circTMTC3 and circFAM117B could increase PD-L1 expression via the miR-142-5p/PD-L1 axis, thus reducing T cell activity and leading to immune escape. Overall, our study characterizes circRNA profiles and regulatory networks in ICB-treated patients, and highlights the clinical utility of circRNAs as predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy."
525,Machine learning-driven multifunctional peptide engineering for sustained ocular drug delivery,"Sustained drug delivery strategies have many potential benefits for treating a range of diseases, particularly chronic diseases that require treatment for years. For many chronic ocular diseases, patient adherence to eye drop dosing regimens and the need for frequent intraocular injections are significant barriers to effective disease management. Here, we utilize peptide engineering to impart melanin binding properties to peptide-drug conjugates to act as a sustained-release depot in the eye. We develop a super learning-based methodology to engineer multifunctional peptides that efficiently enter cells, bind to melanin, and have low cytotoxicity. When the lead multifunctional peptide (HR97) is conjugated to brimonidine, an intraocular pressure lowering drug that is prescribed for three times per day topical dosing, intraocular pressure reduction is observed for up to 18 days after a single intracameral injection in rabbits. Further, the cumulative intraocular pressure lowering effect increases ~17-fold compared to free brimonidine injection. Engineered multifunctional peptide-drug conjugates are a promising approach for providing sustained therapeutic delivery in the eye and beyond."

We benchmark scSpace with both simulated and biological datasets, and demonstrate that scSpace can accurately and robustly identify spatially variated cell subpopulations. When employed to reconstruct the spatial architectures of complex tissue such as the brain cortex, the small intestinal villus, the liver lobule, the kidney, the embryonic heart, and others, scSpace shows promising performance on revealing the pairwise cellular spatial association within single-cell data. The application of scSpace in melanoma and COVID-19 exhibits a broad prospect in the discovery of spatial therapeutic markers."
527,Single-cell RNA-seq uncovers dynamic processes orchestrated by RNA-binding protein DDX43 in chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis,"Mammalian spermatogenesis shows prominent chromatin and transcriptomic switches in germ cells, but it is unclear how such dynamics are controlled. Here we identify RNA helicase DDX43 as an essential regulator of the chromatin remodeling process during spermiogenesis. Testis-specific 
Ddx43
 knockout mice show male infertility with defective histone-to-protamine replacement and post-meiotic chromatin condensation defects. The loss of its ATP hydrolysis activity by a missense mutation replicates the infertility phenotype in global 
Ddx43
 knockout mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of germ cells depleted of 
Ddx43
 or expressing the 
Ddx43
 ATPase-dead mutant reveals that DDX43 regulates dynamic RNA regulatory processes that underlie spermatid chromatin remodeling and differentiation. Transcriptomic profiling focusing on early-stage spermatids combined with enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing further identifies 
Elfn2
 as DDX43-targeted hub gene. These findings illustrate an essential role for DDX43 in spermiogenesis and highlight the single-cell-based strategy to dissect cell-state-specific regulation of male germline development."
528,"Virus diversity, wildlife-domestic animal circulation and potential zoonotic viruses of small mammals, pangolins and zoo animals","Wildlife is reservoir of emerging viruses. Here we identified 27 families of mammalian viruses from 1981 wild animals and 194 zoo animals collected from south China between 2015 and 2022, isolated and characterized the pathogenicity of eight viruses. Bats harbor high diversity of coronaviruses, picornaviruses and astroviruses, and a potentially novel genus of 
Bornaviridae
. In addition to the reported SARSr-CoV-2 and HKU4-CoV-like viruses, picornavirus and respiroviruses also likely circulate between bats and pangolins. Pikas harbor a new clade of Embecovirus and a new genus of arenaviruses. Further, the potential cross-species transmission of RNA viruses (paramyxovirus and astrovirus) and DNA viruses (pseudorabies virus, porcine circovirus 2, porcine circovirus 3 and parvovirus) between wildlife and domestic animals was identified, complicating wildlife protection and the prevention and control of these diseases in domestic animals. This study provides a nuanced view of the frequency of host-jumping events, as well as assessments of zoonotic risk."
529,PeakDecoder enables machine learning-based metabolite annotation and accurate profiling in multidimensional mass spectrometry measurements,"Multidimensional measurements using state-of-the-art separations and mass spectrometry provide advantages in untargeted metabolomics analyses for studying biological and environmental bio-chemical processes. However, the lack of rapid analytical methods and robust algorithms for these heterogeneous data has limited its application. Here, we develop and evaluate a sensitive and high-throughput analytical and computational workflow to enable accurate metabolite profiling. Our workflow combines liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry with PeakDecoder, a machine learning-based algorithm that learns to distinguish true co-elution and co-mobility from raw data and calculates metabolite identification error rates. We apply PeakDecoder for metabolite profiling of various engineered strains of 
Aspergillus pseudoterreus, Aspergillus niger, Pseudomonas putida
 and 
Rhodosporidium toruloides
. Results, validated manually and against selected reaction monitoring and gas-chromatography platforms, show that 2683 features could be confidently annotated and quantified across 116 microbial sample runs using a library built from 64 standards."
530,Cross-modal autoencoder framework learns holistic representations of cardiovascular state,"A fundamental challenge in diagnostics is integrating multiple modalities to develop a joint characterization of physiological state. Using the heart as a model system, we develop a cross-modal autoencoder framework for integrating distinct data modalities and constructing a holistic representation of cardiovascular state. In particular, we use our framework to construct such cross-modal representations from cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs), containing structural information, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), containing myoelectric information. We leverage the learned cross-modal representation to (1) improve phenotype prediction from a single, accessible phenotype such as ECGs; (2) enable imputation of hard-to-acquire cardiac MRIs from easy-to-acquire ECGs; and (3) develop a framework for performing genome-wide association studies in an unsupervised manner. Our results systematically integrate distinct diagnostic modalities into a common representation that better characterizes physiologic state."
531,The Newfoundland and Labrador mosaic founder population descends from an Irish and British diaspora from 300 years ago,"The founder population of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) is a unique genetic resource, in part due to its geographic and cultural isolation, where historical records describe a migration of European settlers, primarily from Ireland and England, to NL in the 18th and 19th centuries. Whilst its historical isolation, and increased prevalence of certain monogenic disorders are well appreciated, details of the fine-scale genetic structure and ancestry of the population are lacking. Understanding the genetic origins and background of functional, disease causing, genetic variants would aid genetic mapping efforts in the Province. Here, we leverage dense genome-wide SNP data on 1,807 NL individuals to reveal fine-scale genetic structure in NL that is clustered around coastal communities and correlated with Christian denomination. We show that the majority of NL European ancestry can be traced back to the south-east and south-west of Ireland and England, respectively. We date a substantial population size bottleneck approximately 10-15 generations ago in NL, associated with increased haplotype sharing and autozygosity. Our results reveal insights into the population history of NL and demonstrate evidence of a population conducive to further genetic studies and biomarker discovery."
532,MASI enables fast model-free standardization and integration of single-cell transcriptomics data,"Single-cell transcriptomics datasets from the same anatomical sites generated by different research labs are becoming increasingly common. However, fast and computationally inexpensive tools for standardization of cell-type annotation and data integration are still needed in order to increase research inclusivity. To standardize cell-type annotation and integrate single-cell transcriptomics datasets, we have built a fast model-free integration method, named MASI (Marker-Assisted Standardization and Integration). We benchmark MASI with other well-established methods and demonstrate that MASI outperforms other methods, in terms of integration, annotation, and speed. To harness knowledge from single-cell atlases, we demonstrate three case studies that cover integration across biological conditions, surveyed participants, and research groups, respectively. Finally, we show MASI can annotate approximately one million cells on a personal laptop, making large-scale single-cell data integration more accessible. We envision that MASI can serve as a cheap computational alternative for the single-cell research community."
533,An interactive murine single-cell atlas of the lung responses to radiation injury,"Radiation Induced Lung Injury (RILI) is one of the main limiting factors of thorax irradiation, which can induce acute pneumonitis as well as pulmonary fibrosis, the latter being a life-threatening condition. The order of cellular and molecular events in the progression towards fibrosis is key to the physiopathogenesis of the disease, yet their coordination in space and time remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an interactive murine single cell atlas of the lung response to irradiation, generated from C57BL6/J female mice. This tool opens the door for exploration of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the mechanisms that lead to radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. It depicts with unprecedented detail cell type-specific radiation-induced responses associated with either lung regeneration or the failure thereof. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to lung fibrosis will help finding new therapeutic options that could improve patients’ quality of life."
534,Mapping the functional interactions at the tumor-immune checkpoint interface,"The interactions between tumor intrinsic processes and immune checkpoints can mediate immune evasion by cancer cells and responses to immunotherapy. It is, however, challenging to identify functional interactions due to the prohibitively complex molecular landscape of the tumor-immune interfaces. We address this challenge with a statistical analysis framework, immuno-oncology gene interaction maps (ImogiMap). ImogiMap quantifies and statistically validates tumor-immune checkpoint interactions based on their co-associations with immune-associated phenotypes. The outcome is a catalog of tumor-immune checkpoint interaction maps for diverse immune-associated phenotypes. Applications of ImogiMap recapitulate the interaction of SERPINB9 and immune checkpoints with interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression. Our analyses suggest that CD86-CD70 and CD274-CD70 immunoregulatory interactions are significantly associated with IFNγ expression in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and basal-like breast cancer, respectively. The open-source ImogiMap software and user-friendly web application will enable future applications of ImogiMap. Such applications may guide the discovery of previously unknown tumor-immune interactions and immunotherapy targets."
535,Sequence-structure-function relationships in the microbial protein universe,"For the past half-century, structural biologists relied on the notion that similar protein sequences give rise to similar structures and functions. While this assumption has driven research to explore certain parts of the protein universe, it disregards spaces that don’t rely on this assumption. Here we explore areas of the protein universe where similar protein functions can be achieved by different sequences and different structures. We predict ~200,000 structures for diverse protein sequences from 1,003 representative genomes across the microbial tree of life and annotate them functionally on a per-residue basis. Structure prediction is accomplished using the World Community Grid, a large-scale citizen science initiative. The resulting database of structural models is complementary to the AlphaFold database, with regards to domains of life as well as sequence diversity and sequence length. We identify 148 novel folds and describe examples where we map specific functions to structural motifs. We also show that the structural space is continuous and largely saturated, highlighting the need for a shift in focus across all branches of biology, from obtaining structures to putting them into context and from sequence-based to sequence-structure-function based meta-omics analyses."
536,Bridging clinic and wildlife care with AI-powered pan-species computational pathology,"Cancers occur across species. Understanding what is consistent and varies across species can provide new insights into cancer initiation and evolution, with significant implications for animal welfare and wildlife conservation. We build a pan-species cancer digital pathology atlas (panspecies.ai) and conduct a pan-species study of computational comparative pathology using a supervised convolutional neural network algorithm trained on human samples. The artificial intelligence algorithm achieves high accuracy in measuring immune response through single-cell classification for two transmissible cancers (canine transmissible venereal tumour, 0.94; Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease, 0.88). In 18 other vertebrate species (mammalia = 11, reptilia = 4, aves = 2, and amphibia = 1), accuracy (range 0.57–0.94) is influenced by cell morphological similarity preserved across different taxonomic groups, tumour sites, and variations in the immune compartment. Furthermore, a spatial immune score based on artificial intelligence and spatial statistics is associated with prognosis in canine melanoma and prostate tumours. A metric, named morphospace overlap, is developed to guide veterinary pathologists towards rational deployment of this technology on new samples. This study provides the foundation and guidelines for transferring artificial intelligence technologies to veterinary pathology based on understanding of morphological conservation, which could vastly accelerate developments in veterinary medicine and comparative oncology."
537,"Fast, accurate antibody structure prediction from deep learning on massive set of natural antibodies","Antibodies have the capacity to bind a diverse set of antigens, and they have become critical therapeutics and diagnostic molecules. The binding of antibodies is facilitated by a set of six hypervariable loops that are diversified through genetic recombination and mutation. Even with recent advances, accurate structural prediction of these loops remains a challenge. Here, we present IgFold, a fast deep learning method for antibody structure prediction. IgFold consists of a pre-trained language model trained on 558 million natural antibody sequences followed by graph networks that directly predict backbone atom coordinates. IgFold predicts structures of similar or better quality than alternative methods (including AlphaFold) in significantly less time (under 25 s). Accurate structure prediction on this timescale makes possible avenues of investigation that were previously infeasible. As a demonstration of IgFold’s capabilities, we predicted structures for 1.4 million paired antibody sequences, providing structural insights to 500-fold more antibodies than have experimentally determined structures."
538,Teasing out missing reactions in genome-scale metabolic networks through hypergraph learning,"GEnome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs) are powerful tools to predict cellular metabolism and physiological states in living organisms. However, due to our imperfect knowledge of metabolic processes, even highly curated GEMs have knowledge gaps (e.g., missing reactions). Existing gap-filling methods typically require phenotypic data as input to tease out missing reactions. We still lack a computational method for rapid and accurate gap-filling of metabolic networks before experimental data is available. Here we present a deep learning-based method — CHEbyshev Spectral HyperlInk pREdictor (CHESHIRE) — to predict missing reactions in GEMs purely from metabolic network topology. We demonstrate that CHESHIRE outperforms other topology-based methods in predicting artificially removed reactions over 926 high- and intermediate-quality GEMs. Furthermore, CHESHIRE is able to improve the phenotypic predictions of 49 draft GEMs for fermentation products and amino acids secretions. Both types of validation suggest that CHESHIRE is a powerful tool for GEM curation to reveal unknown links between reactions and observed metabolic phenotypes."
539,A machine learning model identifies patients in need of autoimmune disease testing using electronic health records,"Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) can lead to irreversible damage if left untreated, yet these patients often endure long diagnostic journeys before being diagnosed and treated. Machine learning may help overcome the challenges of diagnosing SARDs and inform clinical decision-making. Here, we developed and tested a machine learning model to identify patients who should receive rheumatological evaluation for SARDs using longitudinal electronic health records of 161,584 individuals from two institutions. The model demonstrated high performance for predicting cases of autoantibody-tested individuals in a validation set, an external test set, and an independent cohort with a broader case definition. This approach identified more individuals for autoantibody testing compared with current clinical standards and a greater proportion of autoantibody carriers among those tested. Diagnoses of SARDs and other autoimmune conditions increased with higher model probabilities. The model detected a need for autoantibody testing and rheumatology encounters up to five years before the test date and assessment date, respectively. Altogether, these findings illustrate that the clinical manifestations of a diverse array of autoimmune conditions are detectable in electronic health records using machine learning, which may help systematize and accelerate autoimmune testing."
540,Sample-to-answer platform for the clinical evaluation of COVID-19 using a deep learning-assisted smartphone-based assay,"Since many lateral flow assays (LFA) are tested daily, the improvement in accuracy can greatly impact individual patient care and public health. However, current self-testing for COVID-19 detection suffers from low accuracy, mainly due to the LFA sensitivity and reading ambiguities. Here, we present deep learning-assisted smartphone-based LFA (SMART
AI
-LFA) diagnostics to provide accurate decisions with higher sensitivity. Combining clinical data learning and two-step algorithms enables a cradle-free on-site assay with higher accuracy than the untrained individuals and human experts via blind tests of clinical data (
n
 = 1500). We acquired 98% accuracy across 135 smartphone application-based clinical tests with different users/smartphones. Furthermore, with more low-titer tests, we observed that the accuracy of SMART
AI
-LFA was maintained at over 99% while there was a significant decrease in human accuracy, indicating the reliable performance of SMART
AI
-LFA. We envision a smartphone-based SMART
AI
-LFA that allows continuously enhanced performance by adding clinical tests and satisfies the new criterion for digitalized real-time diagnostics."
541,A massively parallel screening platform for converting aptamers into molecular switches,"Aptamer-based molecular switches that undergo a binding-induced conformational change have proven valuable for a wide range of applications, such as imaging metabolites in cells, targeted drug delivery, and real-time detection of biomolecules. Since conventional aptamer selection methods do not typically produce aptamers with inherent structure-switching functionality, the aptamers must be converted to molecular switches in a post-selection process. Efforts to engineer such aptamer switches often use rational design approaches based on in silico secondary structure predictions. Unfortunately, existing software cannot accurately model three-dimensional oligonucleotide structures or non-canonical base-pairing, limiting the ability to identify appropriate sequence elements for targeted modification. Here, we describe a massively parallel screening-based strategy that enables the conversion of virtually any aptamer into a molecular switch without requiring any prior knowledge of aptamer structure. Using this approach, we generate multiple switches from a previously published ATP aptamer as well as a newly-selected boronic acid base-modified aptamer for glucose, which respectively undergo signal-on and signal-off switching upon binding their molecular targets with second-scale kinetics. Notably, our glucose-responsive switch achieves ~30-fold greater sensitivity than a previously-reported natural DNA-based switch. We believe our approach could offer a generalizable strategy for producing target-specific switches from a wide range of aptamers."
542,Computational design and molecular dynamics simulations suggest the mode of substrate binding in ceramide synthases,"Until now, membrane-protein stabilization has relied on iterations of mutations and screening. We now validate a one-step algorithm, mPROSS, for stabilizing membrane proteins directly from an AlphaFold2 model structure. Applied to the lipid-generating enzyme, ceramide synthase, 37 designed mutations lead to a more stable form of human CerS2. Together with molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a pathway by which substrates might be delivered to the ceramide synthases."
543,HaploCoV: unsupervised classification and rapid detection of novel emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2,"Accurate and timely monitoring of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for identifying and tracking potentially more transmissible/virulent viral variants, and implement mitigation strategies to limit their spread. Here we introduce HaploCoV, a novel software framework that enables the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity through space and time, to identify novel emerging viral variants and prioritize variants of potential epidemiological interest in a rapid and unsupervised manner. HaploCoV can integrate with any classification/nomenclature and incorporates an effective scoring system for the prioritization of SARS-CoV-2 variants. By performing retrospective analyses of more than 11.5 M genome sequences we show that HaploCoV demonstrates high levels of accuracy and reproducibility and identifies the large majority of epidemiologically relevant viral variants - as flagged by international health authorities – automatically and with rapid turn-around times.
Our results highlight the importance of the application of strategies based on the systematic analysis and integration of regional data for rapid identification of novel, emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. We believe that the approach outlined in this study will contribute to relevant advances to current and future genomic surveillance methods."
544,Transcription factor binding site orientation and order are major drivers of gene regulatory activity,"The gene regulatory code and grammar remain largely unknown, precluding our ability to link phenotype to genotype in regulatory sequences. Here, using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) of 209,440 sequences, we examine all possible pair and triplet combinations, permutations and orientations of eighteen liver-associated transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We find that TFBS orientation and order have a major effect on gene regulatory activity. Corroborating these results with genomic analyses, we find clear human promoter TFBS orientation biases and similar TFBS orientation and order transcriptional effects in an MPRA that tested 164,307 liver candidate regulatory elements. Additionally, by adding TFBS orientation to a model that predicts expression from sequence we improve performance by 7.7%. Collectively, our results show that TFBS orientation and order have a significant effect on gene regulatory activity and need to be considered when analyzing the functional effect of variants on the activity of these sequences."
545,Machine learning reveals limited contribution of trans-only encoded variants to the HLA-DQ immunopeptidome,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antigen presentation is key for controlling and triggering T cell immune responses. HLA-DQ molecules, which are believed to play a major role in autoimmune diseases, are heterodimers that can be formed as both cis and trans variants depending on whether the α- and β-chains are encoded on the same (cis) or opposite (trans) chromosomes. So far, limited progress has been made for predicting HLA-DQ antigen presentation. In addition, the contribution of trans-only variants (i.e. variants not observed in the population as cis) in shaping the HLA-DQ immunopeptidome remains largely unresolved. Here, we seek to address these issues by integrating state-of-the-art immunoinformatics data mining models with large volumes of high-quality HLA-DQ specific mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics data. The analysis demonstrates highly improved predictive power and molecular coverage for models trained including these novel HLA-DQ data. More importantly, investigating the role of trans-only HLA-DQ variants reveals a limited to no contribution to the overall HLA-DQ immunopeptidome.

546,DeepFLR facilitates false localization rate control in phosphoproteomics,"Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification crucial for many cellular processes and protein functions. Accurate identification and quantification of protein phosphosites at the proteome-wide level are challenging, not least because efficient tools for protein phosphosite false localization rate (FLR) control are lacking. Here, we propose DeepFLR, a deep learning-based framework for controlling the FLR in phosphoproteomics. DeepFLR includes a phosphopeptide tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS) prediction module based on deep learning and an FLR assessment module based on a target-decoy approach. DeepFLR improves the accuracy of phosphopeptide MS/MS prediction compared to existing tools. Furthermore, DeepFLR estimates FLR accurately for both synthetic and biological datasets, and localizes more phosphosites than probability-based methods. DeepFLR is compatible with data from different organisms, instruments types, and both data-dependent and data-independent acquisition approaches, thus enabling FLR estimation for a broad range of phosphoproteomics experiments."
547,Universal structures for adaptation in biochemical reaction networks,"At the molecular level, the evolution of life is driven by the generation and diversification of adaptation mechanisms. A universal description of adaptation-capable chemical reaction network (CRN) structures has remained elusive until now, since currently-known criteria for adaptation apply only to a tiny subset of possible CRNs. Here we identify the definitive structural requirements that characterize all adaptation-capable collections of interacting molecules, however large or complex. We show that these network structures implement a form of integral control in which multiple independent integrals can collaborate to confer the capacity for adaptation on specific molecules. Using an algebraic algorithm informed by these findings, we demonstrate the existence of embedded integrals in a variety of biologically important CRNs that have eluded previous methods, and for which adaptation has been observed experimentally. This definitive picture of biological adaptation at the level of intermolecular interactions represents a blueprint for adaptation-capable signaling networks across all domains of life, and for the design of synthetic biosystems."
548,Identifying high-impact variants and genes in exomes of Ashkenazi Jewish inflammatory bowel disease patients,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic digestive tract inflammatory conditions whose genetic etiology is still poorly understood. The incidence of IBD is particularly high among Ashkenazi Jews. Here, we identify 8 novel and plausible IBD-causing genes from the exomes of 4453 genetically identified Ashkenazi Jewish IBD cases (1734) and controls (2719). Various biological pathway analyses are performed, along with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, to demonstrate the likely physiological relatedness of the novel genes to IBD. Importantly, we demonstrate that the rare and high impact genetic architecture of Ashkenazi Jewish adult IBD displays significant overlap with very early onset-IBD genetics. Moreover, by performing biobank phenome-wide analyses, we find that IBD genes have pleiotropic effects that involve other immune responses. Finally, we show that polygenic risk score analyses based on genome-wide high impact variants have high power to predict IBD susceptibility."
549,Integrated transcriptome landscape of ALS identifies genome instability linked to TDP-43 pathology,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) causes motor neuron degeneration, with 97% of cases exhibiting TDP-43 proteinopathy. Elucidating pathomechanisms has been hampered by disease heterogeneity and difficulties accessing motor neurons. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons (iPSMNs) offer a solution; however, studies have typically been limited to underpowered cohorts. Here, we present a comprehensive compendium of 429 iPSMNs from 15 datasets, and 271 post-mortem spinal cord samples. Using reproducible bioinformatic workflows, we identify robust upregulation of p53 signalling in ALS in both iPSMNs and post-mortem spinal cord. p53 activation is greatest with 
C9orf72
 repeat expansions but is weakest with SOD1 and FUS mutations. TDP-43 depletion potentiates p53 activation in both post-mortem neuronal nuclei and cell culture, thereby functionally linking p53 activation with TDP-43 depletion. ALS iPSMNs and post-mortem tissue display enrichment of splicing alterations, somatic mutations, and gene fusions, possibly contributing to the DNA damage response."
550,Latent generative landscapes as maps of functional diversity in protein sequence space,"Variational autoencoders are unsupervised learning models with generative capabilities, when applied to protein data, they classify sequences by phylogeny and generate de novo sequences which preserve statistical properties of protein composition. While previous studies focus on clustering and generative features, here, we evaluate the underlying latent manifold in which sequence information is embedded. To investigate properties of the latent manifold, we utilize direct coupling analysis and a Potts Hamiltonian model to construct a latent generative landscape. We showcase how this landscape captures phylogenetic groupings, functional and fitness properties of several systems including Globins, 
β
-lactamases, ion channels, and transcription factors. We provide support on how the landscape helps us understand the effects of sequence variability observed in experimental data and provides insights on directed and natural protein evolution. We propose that combining generative properties and functional predictive power of variational autoencoders and coevolutionary analysis could be beneficial in applications for protein engineering and design."
551,DeMAG predicts the effects of variants in clinically actionable genes by integrating structural and evolutionary epistatic features,"Despite the increasing use of genomic sequencing in clinical practice, the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains challenging even in well-studied disease genes, resulting in many patients with Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUSs). Computational Variant Effect Predictors (VEPs) provide valuable evidence in variant assessment, but they are prone to misclassifying benign variants, contributing to false positives. Here, we develop Deciphering Mutations in Actionable Genes (DeMAG), a supervised classifier for missense variants trained using extensive diagnostic data available in 59 actionable disease genes (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Secondary Findings v2.0, ACMG SF v2.0). DeMAG improves performance over existing VEPs by reaching balanced specificity (82%) and sensitivity (94%) on clinical data, and includes a novel epistatic feature, the 
‘
partners score’, which leverages evolutionary and structural partnerships of residues. The ‘partners score’ provides a general framework for modeling epistatic interactions, integrating both clinical and functional information. We provide our tool and predictions for all missense variants in 316 clinically actionable disease genes (demag.org) to facilitate the interpretation of variants and improve clinical decision-making."
552,Multi-omic underpinnings of epigenetic aging and human longevity,"Biological aging is accompanied by increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs; however, its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we use multi-omic methods to integrate genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data and identify biological associations with four measures of epigenetic age acceleration and a human longevity phenotype comprising healthspan, lifespan, and exceptional longevity (multivariate longevity). Using transcriptomic imputation, fine-mapping, and conditional analysis, we identify 22 high confidence associations with epigenetic age acceleration and seven with multivariate longevity. 
FLOT1
, 
KPNA4
, and 
TMX2
 are novel, high confidence genes associated with epigenetic age acceleration. In parallel, cis-instrument Mendelian randomization of the druggable genome associates 
TPMT
 and 
NHLRC1
 with epigenetic aging, supporting transcriptomic imputation findings. Metabolomics Mendelian randomization identifies a negative effect of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and associated lipoproteins on multivariate longevity, but not epigenetic age acceleration. Finally, cell-type enrichment analysis implicates immune cells and precursors in epigenetic age acceleration and, more modestly, multivariate longevity. Follow-up Mendelian randomization of immune cell traits suggests lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphocytic surface molecules affect multivariate longevity and epigenetic age acceleration. Our results highlight druggable targets and biological pathways involved in aging and facilitate multi-omic comparisons of epigenetic clocks and human longevity."
553,Mapping genomic regulation of kidney disease and traits through high-resolution and interpretable eQTLs,"Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies illuminate genomic variants that regulate specific genes and contribute to fine-mapped loci discovered via genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Efforts to maximize their accuracy are ongoing. Using 240 glomerular (GLOM) and 311 tubulointerstitial (TUBE) micro-dissected samples from human kidney biopsies, we discovered 5371 GLOM and 9787 TUBE genes with at least one variant significantly associated with expression (eGene) by incorporating kidney single-nucleus open chromatin data and transcription start site distance as an “integrative prior” for Bayesian statistical fine-mapping. The use of an integrative prior resulted in higher resolution eQTLs illustrated by (1) smaller numbers of variants in credible sets with greater confidence, (2) increased enrichment of partitioned heritability for GWAS of two kidney traits, (3) an increased number of variants colocalized with the GWAS loci, and (4) enrichment of computationally predicted functional regulatory variants. A subset of variants and genes were validated experimentally in vitro and using a 
Drosophila
 nephrocyte model. More broadly, this study demonstrates that tissue-specific eQTL maps informed by single-nucleus open chromatin data have enhanced utility for diverse downstream analyses."
554,Direct correction of haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia using base editors,"Haemoglobin E (HbE) β-thalassaemia causes approximately 50% of all severe thalassaemia worldwide; equating to around 30,000 births per year. HbE β-thalassaemia is due to a point mutation in codon 26 of the human 
HBB
 gene on one allele (GAG; glutamatic acid → AAG; lysine, E26K), and any mutation causing severe β-thalassaemia on the other. When inherited together in compound heterozygosity these mutations can cause a severe thalassaemic phenotype. However, if only one allele is mutated individuals are carriers for the respective mutation and have an asymptomatic phenotype (β-thalassaemia trait). Here we describe a base editing strategy which corrects the HbE mutation either to wildtype (WT) or a normal variant haemoglobin (E26G) known as Hb Aubenas and thereby recreates the asymptomatic trait phenotype. We have achieved editing efficiencies in excess of 90% in primary human CD34 + cells. We demonstrate editing of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) using serial xenotransplantation in NSG mice. We have profiled the off-target effects using a combination of circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq) and deep targeted capture and have developed machine-learning based methods to predict functional effects of candidate off-target mutations."
555,Vaccination of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals expands a broad range of clonally diverse affinity-matured B cell lineages,"Vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals generates broad and potent antibody responses. Here, we isolate 459 spike-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from two individuals who were infected with the index variant of SARS-CoV-2 and later boosted with mRNA-1273. We characterize mAb genetic features by sequence assignments to the donors’ personal immunoglobulin genotypes and assess antibody neutralizing activities against index SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. The mAbs used a broad range of immunoglobulin heavy chain (
IGH
) V genes in the response to all sub-determinants of the spike examined, with similar characteristics observed in both donors. 
IGH
 repertoire sequencing and B cell lineage tracing at longitudinal time points reveals extensive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies from acute infection until vaccination five months later. These results demonstrate that highly polyclonal repertoires of affinity-matured memory B cells are efficiently recalled by vaccination, providing a basis for the potent antibody responses observed in convalescent persons following vaccination."
556,Accounting for assay performance when estimating the temporal dynamics in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the U.S.,"Reconstructing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is central to understanding the state of the pandemic. Seroprevalence studies are often used to assess cumulative infections as they can identify asymptomatic infection. Since July 2020, commercial laboratories have conducted nationwide serosurveys for the U.S. CDC. They employed three assays, with different sensitivities and specificities, potentially introducing biases in seroprevalence estimates. Using models, we show that accounting for assays explains some of the observed state-to-state variation in seroprevalence, and when integrating case and death surveillance data, we show that when using the Abbott assay, estimates of proportions infected can differ substantially from seroprevalence estimates. We also found that states with higher proportions infected (before or after vaccination) had lower vaccination coverages, a pattern corroborated using a separate dataset. Finally, to understand vaccination rates relative to the increase in cases, we estimated the proportions of the population that received a vaccine prior to infection."
557,Complex computation from developmental priors,"Machine learning (ML) models have long overlooked innateness: how strong pressures for survival lead to the encoding of complex behaviors in the nascent wiring of a brain. Here, we derive a neurodevelopmental encoding of artificial neural networks that considers the weight matrix of a neural network to be emergent from well-studied rules of neuronal compatibility. Rather than updating the network’s weights directly, we improve task fitness by updating the neurons’ wiring rules, thereby mirroring evolutionary selection on brain development. We find that our model (1) provides sufficient representational power for high accuracy on ML benchmarks while also compressing parameter count, and (2) can act as a regularizer, selecting simple circuits that provide stable and adaptive performance on metalearning tasks. In summary, by introducing neurodevelopmental considerations into ML frameworks, we not only model the emergence of innate behaviors, but also define a discovery process for structures that promote complex computations."
558,PepQuery2 democratizes public MS proteomics data for rapid peptide searching,"We present PepQuery2, which leverages a new tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data indexing approach to enable ultrafast, targeted identification of novel and known peptides in any local or publicly available MS proteomics datasets. The stand-alone version of PepQuery2 allows directly searching more than one billion indexed MS/MS spectra in the PepQueryDB or any public datasets from PRIDE, MassIVE, iProX, or jPOSTrepo, whereas the web version enables users to search datasets in PepQueryDB with a user-friendly interface. We demonstrate the utilities of PepQuery2 in a wide range of applications including detecting proteomic evidence for genomically predicted novel peptides, validating novel and known peptides identified using spectrum-centric database searching, prioritizing tumor-specific antigens, identifying missing proteins, and selecting proteotypic peptides for targeted proteomics experiments. By putting public MS proteomics data directly into the hands of scientists, PepQuery2 opens many new ways to transform these data into useful information for the broad research community."
559,Bladder cancer organoids as a functional system to model different disease stages and therapy response,"Bladder Cancer (BLCa) inter-patient heterogeneity is the primary cause of treatment failure, suggesting that patients could benefit from a more personalized treatment approach. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been successfully used as a functional model for predicting drug response in different cancers. In our study, we establish PDO cultures from different BLCa stages and grades. PDOs preserve the histological and molecular heterogeneity of the parental tumors, including their multiclonal genetic landscapes, and consistently share key genetic alterations, mirroring tumor evolution in longitudinal sampling. Our drug screening pipeline is implemented using PDOs, testing standard-of-care and FDA-approved compounds for other tumors. Integrative analysis of drug response profiles with matched PDO genomic analysis is used to determine enrichment thresholds for candidate markers of therapy response and resistance. Finally, by assessing the clinical history of longitudinally sampled cases, we can determine whether the disease clonal evolution matched with drug response."
560,PeSTo: parameter-free geometric deep learning for accurate prediction of protein binding interfaces,"Proteins are essential molecular building blocks of life, responsible for most biological functions as a result of their specific molecular interactions. However, predicting their  binding  interfaces remains a challenge. In this study, we present a geometric transformer that acts directly on atomic coordinates labeled only with element names. The resulting model—the Protein Structure Transformer, PeSTo—surpasses the current state of the art in predicting protein-protein interfaces and can also predict and differentiate between interfaces involving nucleic acids, lipids, ions, and small molecules with high confidence. Its low computational cost enables processing high volumes of structural data, such as molecular dynamics ensembles allowing for the discovery of interfaces that remain otherwise inconspicuous in static experimentally solved structures. Moreover, the growing foldome provided by de novo structural predictions can be easily analyzed, providing new opportunities to uncover unexplored biology."
561,BigNeuron: a resource to benchmark and predict performance of algorithms for automated tracing of neurons in light microscopy datasets,"BigNeuron is an open community bench-testing platform with the goal of setting open standards for accurate and fast automatic neuron tracing. We gathered a diverse set of image volumes across several species that is representative of the data obtained in many neuroscience laboratories interested in neuron tracing. Here, we report generated gold standard manual annotations for a subset of the available imaging datasets and quantified tracing quality for 35 automatic tracing algorithms. The goal of generating such a hand-curated diverse dataset is to advance the development of tracing algorithms and enable generalizable benchmarking. Together with image quality features, we pooled the data in an interactive web application that enables users and developers to perform principal component analysis, 
t
-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, correlation and clustering, visualization of imaging and tracing data, and benchmarking of automatic tracing algorithms in user-defined data subsets. The image quality metrics explain most of the variance in the data, followed by neuromorphological features related to neuron size. We observed that diverse algorithms can provide complementary information to obtain accurate results and developed a method to iteratively combine methods and generate consensus reconstructions. The consensus trees obtained provide estimates of the neuron structure ground truth that typically outperform single algorithms in noisy datasets. However, specific algorithms may outperform the consensus tree strategy in specific imaging conditions. Finally, to aid users in predicting the most accurate automatic tracing results without manual annotations for comparison, we used support vector machine regression to predict reconstruction quality given an image volume and a set of automatic tracings."
562,Does AlphaFold2 model proteins’ intracellular conformations? An experimental test using cross-linking mass spectrometry of endogenous ciliary proteins,"A major goal in structural biology is to understand protein assemblies in their biologically relevant states. Here, we investigate whether AlphaFold2 structure predictions match native protein conformations. We chemically cross-linked proteins in situ within intact 
Tetrahymena thermophila
 cilia and native ciliary extracts, identifying 1,225 intramolecular cross-links within the 100 best-sampled proteins, providing a benchmark of distance restraints obeyed by proteins in their native assemblies. The corresponding structure predictions were highly concordant, positioning 86.2% of cross-linked residues within Cɑ-to-Cɑ distances of 30 Å, consistent with the cross-linker length. 43% of proteins showed no violations. Most inconsistencies occurred in low-confidence regions or between domains. Overall, AlphaFold2 predictions with lower predicted aligned error corresponded to more correct native structures. However, we observe cases where rigid body domains are oriented incorrectly, as for ciliary protein BBC118, suggesting that combining structure prediction with experimental information will better reveal biologically relevant conformations."
563,"Next-generation large-scale binary protein interaction network for 
Drosophila melanogaster","Generating reference maps of interactome networks illuminates genetic studies by providing a protein-centric approach to finding new components of existing pathways, complexes, and processes. We apply state-of-the-art methods to identify binary protein-protein interactions (PPIs) for 
Drosophila melanogaster
. Four all-by-all yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens of > 10,000 
Drosophila
 proteins result in the ‘FlyBi’ dataset of 8723 PPIs among 2939 proteins. Testing subsets of data from FlyBi and previous PPI studies using an orthogonal assay allows for normalization of data quality; subsequent integration of FlyBi and previous data results in an expanded binary 
Drosophila
 reference interaction network, DroRI, comprising 17,232 interactions among 6511 proteins. We use FlyBi data to generate an autophagy network, then validate in vivo using autophagy-related assays. The 
deformed wings
 (
dwg
) gene encodes a protein that is both a regulator and a target of autophagy. Altogether, these resources provide a foundation for building new hypotheses regarding protein networks and function."
564,ALAN is a computational approach that interprets genomic findings in the context of tumor ecosystems,"Gene behavior is governed by activity of other genes in an ecosystem as well as context-specific cues including cell type, microenvironment, and prior exposure to therapy. Here, we developed the Algorithm for Linking Activity Networks (ALAN) to compare gene behavior purely based on patient -omic data. The types of gene behaviors identifiable by ALAN include co-regulators of a signaling pathway, protein-protein interactions, or any set of genes that function similarly. ALAN identified direct protein-protein interactions in prostate cancer (AR, HOXB13, and FOXA1). We found differential and complex ALAN networks associated with the proto-oncogene MYC as prostate tumors develop and become metastatic, between different cancer types, and within cancer subtypes. We discovered that resistant genes in prostate cancer shared an ALAN ecosystem and activated similar oncogenic signaling pathways. Altogether, ALAN represents an informatics approach for developing gene signatures, identifying gene targets, and interpreting mechanisms of progression or therapy resistance."
565,A multi-omics integrative analysis based on CRISPR screens re-defines the pluripotency regulatory network in ESCs,"A comprehensive and precise definition of the pluripotency gene regulatory network (PGRN) is crucial for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, after a CRISPR/Cas9-based functional genomics screen and integrative analysis with other functional genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and epigenome data, an expanded pluripotency-associated gene set is obtained, and a new PGRN with nine sub-classes is constructed. By integrating the DNA binding, epigenetic modification, chromatin conformation, and RNA expression profiles, the PGRN is resolved to six functionally independent transcriptional modules (CORE, MYC, PAF, PRC, PCGF and TBX). Spatiotemporal transcriptomics reveal activated CORE/MYC/PAF module activity and repressed PRC/PCGF/TBX module activity in both mouse ESCs (mESCs) and pluripotent cells of early embryos. Moreover, this module activity pattern is found to be shared by human ESCs (hESCs) and cancers. Thus, our results provide novel insights into elucidating the molecular basis of ESC pluripotency."
566,Drivers of SARS-CoV-2 testing behaviour: a modelling study using nationwide testing data in England,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, national testing programmes were conducted worldwide on unprecedented scales. While testing behaviour is generally recognised as dynamic and complex, current literature demonstrating and quantifying such relationships is scarce, despite its importance for infectious disease surveillance and control. Here, we characterise the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, disease susceptibility/severity, risk perception, and public health measures on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing behaviour in England over 20 months of the pandemic, by linking testing trends to underlying epidemic trends and contextual meta-data within a systematic conceptual framework. The best-fitting model describing SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing behaviour explained close to 80% of the total deviance in NHS test data. Testing behaviour showed complex associations with factors reflecting transmission level, disease susceptibility/severity (e.g. age, dominant variant, and vaccination), public health measures (e.g. testing strategies and lockdown), and associated changes in risk perception, varying throughout the pandemic and differing between infected and non-infected people."
567,BUDDY: molecular formula discovery via bottom-up MS/MS interrogation,"A substantial fraction of metabolic features remains undetermined in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics, and molecular formula annotation is the starting point for unraveling their chemical identities. Here we present bottom-up tandem MS (MS/MS) interrogation, a method for de novo formula annotation. Our approach prioritizes MS/MS-explainable formula candidates, implements machine-learned ranking and offers false discovery rate estimation. Compared with the mathematically exhaustive formula enumeration, our approach shrinks the formula candidate space by 42.8% on average. Method benchmarking on annotation accuracy was systematically carried out on reference MS/MS libraries and real metabolomics datasets. Applied on 155,321 recurrent unidentified spectra, our approach confidently annotated >5,000 novel molecular formulae absent from chemical databases. Beyond the level of individual metabolic features, we combined bottom-up MS/MS interrogation with global optimization to refine formula annotations while revealing peak interrelationships. This approach allowed the systematic annotation of 37 fatty acid amide molecules in human fecal data. All bioinformatics pipelines are available in a standalone software, BUDDY (
https://github.com/HuanLab/BUDDY
)."
568,Histopathology images predict multi-omics aberrations and prognoses in colorectal cancer patients,"Histopathologic assessment is indispensable for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, manual evaluation of the diseased tissues under the microscope cannot reliably inform patient prognosis or genomic variations crucial for treatment selections. To address these challenges, we develop the Multi-omics Multi-cohort Assessment (MOMA) platform, an explainable machine learning approach, to systematically identify and interpret the relationship between patients’ histologic patterns, multi-omics, and clinical profiles in three large patient cohorts (
n
 = 1888). MOMA successfully predicts the overall survival, disease-free survival (log-rank test 
P
-value<0.05), and copy number alterations of CRC patients. In addition, our approaches identify interpretable pathology patterns predictive of gene expression profiles, microsatellite instability status, and clinically actionable genetic alterations. We show that MOMA models are generalizable to multiple patient populations with different demographic compositions and pathology images collected from distinctive digitization methods. Our machine learning approaches provide clinically actionable predictions that could inform treatments for colorectal cancer patients."
569,Ripply suppresses Tbx6 to induce dynamic-to-static conversion in somite segmentation,"The metameric pattern of somites is created based on oscillatory expression of clock genes in presomitic mesoderm. However, the mechanism for converting the dynamic oscillation to a static pattern of somites is still unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Ripply/Tbx6 machinery is a key regulator of this conversion. Ripply1/Ripply2-mediated removal of Tbx6 protein defines somite boundary and also leads to cessation of clock gene expression in zebrafish embryos. On the other hand, activation of 
ripply1/ripply2
 mRNA and protein expression is periodically regulated by clock oscillation in conjunction with an Erk signaling gradient. Whereas Ripply protein decreases rapidly in embryos, Ripply-triggered Tbx6 suppression persists long enough to complete somite boundary formation. Mathematical modeling shows that a molecular network based on results of this study can reproduce dynamic-to-static conversion in somitogenesis. Furthermore, simulations with this model suggest that sustained suppression of Tbx6 caused by Ripply is crucial in this conversion."
570,Predictive and robust gene selection for spatial transcriptomics,"A prominent trend in single-cell transcriptomics is providing spatial context alongside a characterization of each cell’s molecular state. This typically requires targeting an a priori selection of genes, often covering less than 1% of the genome, and a key question is how to optimally determine the small gene panel. We address this challenge by introducing a flexible deep learning framework, PERSIST, to identify informative gene targets for spatial transcriptomics studies by leveraging reference scRNA-seq data. Using datasets spanning different brain regions, species, and scRNA-seq technologies, we show that PERSIST reliably identifies panels that provide more accurate prediction of the genome-wide expression profile, thereby capturing more information with fewer genes. PERSIST can be adapted to specific biological goals, and we demonstrate that PERSIST’s binarization of gene expression levels enables models trained on scRNA-seq data to generalize with to spatial transcriptomics data, despite the complex shift between these technologies."
571,PUREE: accurate pan-cancer tumor purity estimation from gene expression data,"Tumors are complex masses composed of malignant and non-malignant cells. Variation in tumor purity (proportion of cancer cells in a sample) can both confound integrative analysis and enable studies of tumor heterogeneity. Here we developed PUREE, which uses a weakly supervised learning approach to infer tumor purity from a tumor gene expression profile. PUREE was trained on gene expression data and genomic consensus purity estimates from 7864 solid tumor samples. PUREE predicted purity with high accuracy across distinct solid tumor types and generalized to tumor samples from unseen tumor types and cohorts. Gene features of PUREE were further validated using single-cell RNA-seq data from distinct tumor types. In a comprehensive benchmark, PUREE outperformed existing transcriptome-based purity estimation approaches. Overall, PUREE is a highly accurate and versatile method for estimating tumor purity and interrogating tumor heterogeneity from bulk tumor gene expression data, which can complement genomics-based approaches or be used in settings where genomic data is unavailable."
572,Harmonizing across datasets to improve the transferability of drug combination prediction,"Combination treatment has multiple advantages over traditional monotherapy in clinics, thus becoming a target of interest for many high-throughput screening (HTS) studies, which enables the development of machine learning models predicting the response of new drug combinations. However, most existing models have been tested only within a single study, and these models cannot generalize across different datasets due to significantly variable experimental settings. Here, we thoroughly assessed the transferability issue of single-study-derived models on new datasets. More importantly, we propose a method to overcome the experimental variability by harmonizing dose–response curves of different studies. Our method improves the prediction performance of machine learning models by 184% and 1367% compared to the baseline models in intra-study and inter-study predictions, respectively, and shows consistent improvement in multiple cross-validation settings. Our study addresses the crucial question of the transferability in drug combination predictions, which is fundamental for such models to be extrapolated to new drug combination discovery and clinical applications that are 
de facto
 different datasets."
573,Performance efficient macromolecular mechanics via sub-nanometer shape based coarse graining,"Dimensionality reduction via coarse grain modeling is a valuable tool in biomolecular research. For large assemblies, ultra coarse models are often knowledge-based, relying on a priori information to parameterize models thus hindering general predictive capability. Here, we present substantial advances to the shape based coarse graining (SBCG) method, which we refer to as SBCG2. SBCG2 utilizes a revitalized formulation of the topology representing network which makes high-granularity modeling possible, preserving atomistic details that maintain assembly characteristics. Further, we present a method of granularity selection based on charge density Fourier Shell Correlation and have additionally developed a refinement method to optimize, adjust and validate high-granularity models. We demonstrate our approach with the conical HIV-1 capsid and heteromultimeric cofilin-2 bound actin filaments. Our approach is available in the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software suite, and employs a CHARMM-compatible Hamiltonian that enables high-performance simulation in the GPU-resident NAMD3 molecular dynamics engine."
574,Comparison of transformations for single-cell RNA-seq data,"The count table, a numeric matrix of genes × cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks."
575,Integrative modeling of tumor genomes and epigenomes for enhanced cancer diagnosis by cell-free DNA,"Multi-cancer early detection remains a key challenge in cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based liquid biopsy. Here, we perform cfDNA whole-genome sequencing to generate two test datasets covering 2125 patient samples of 9 cancer types and 1241 normal control samples, and also a reference dataset for background variant filtering based on 20,529 low-depth healthy samples. An external cfDNA dataset consisting of 208 cancer and 214 normal control samples is used for additional evaluation. Accuracy for cancer detection and tissue-of-origin localization is achieved using our algorithm, which incorporates cancer type-specific profiles of mutation distribution and chromatin organization in tumor tissues as model references. Our integrative model detects early-stage cancers, including those of pancreatic origin, with high sensitivity that is comparable to that of late-stage detection. Model interpretation reveals the contribution of cancer type-specific genomic and epigenomic features. Our methodologies may lay the groundwork for accurate cfDNA-based cancer diagnosis, especially at early stages."
576,High-resolution Nanopore methylome-maps reveal random hyper-methylation at CpG-poor regions as driver of chemoresistance in leukemias,"Aberrant DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is a cancer hallmark that is associated with the emergence of resistance to anti cancer treatment, though molecular mechanisms and biological significance remain elusive. Genome scale methylation maps by currently used methods are based on chemical modification of DNA and are best suited for analyses of methylation at CpG rich regions (CpG islands). We report the first high coverage whole-genome map in cancer using the long read nanopore technology, which allows simultaneous DNA-sequence and -methylation analyses on native DNA. We analyzed clonal epigenomic/genomic evolution in Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AMLs) at diagnosis and relapse, after chemotherapy. Long read sequencing coupled to a novel computational method allowed definition of differential methylation at unprecedented resolution, and showed that the relapse methylome is characterized by hypermethylation at both CpG islands and sparse CpGs regions. Most differentially methylated genes, however, were not differentially expressed nor enriched for chemoresistance genes. A small fraction of under-expressed and hyper-methylated genes at sparse CpGs, in the gene body, was significantly enriched in transcription factors (TFs). Remarkably, these few TFs supported large gene-regulatory networks including 50% of all differentially expressed genes in the relapsed AMLs and highly-enriched in chemoresistance genes. Notably, hypermethylated regions at sparse CpGs were poorly conserved in the relapsed AMLs, under-represented at their genomic positions and showed higher methylation entropy, as compared to CpG islands. Analyses of available datasets confirmed TF binding to their target genes and conservation of the same gene-regulatory networks in large patient cohorts. Relapsed AMLs carried few patient specific structural variants and DNA mutations, apparently not involved in drug resistance. Thus, drug resistance in AMLs can be mainly ascribed to the selection of random epigenetic alterations at sparse CpGs of a few transcription factors, which then induce reprogramming of the relapsing phenotype, independently of clonal genomic evolution."
577,Predicting response to enzalutamide and abiraterone in metastatic prostate cancer using whole-omics machine learning,"Response to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) varies widely in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To improve treatment guidance, biomarkers are needed. We use whole-genomics (WGS; 
n
 = 155) with matching whole-transcriptomics (WTS; 
n
 = 113) from biopsies of ARSI-treated mCRPC patients for unbiased discovery of biomarkers and development of machine learning-based prediction models. Tumor mutational burden (
q
 < 0.001), structural variants (
q
 < 0.05), tandem duplications (
q
 < 0.05) and deletions (
q
 < 0.05) are enriched in poor responders, coupled with distinct transcriptomic expression profiles. Validating various classification models predicting treatment duration with ARSI on our internal and external mCRPC cohort reveals two best-performing models, based on the combination of prior treatment information with either the four combined enriched genomic markers or with overall transcriptomic profiles. In conclusion, predictive models combining genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data can predict response to ARSI in mCRPC patients and, with additional optimization and prospective validation, could improve treatment guidance."
578,Improving the generalizability of protein-ligand binding predictions with AI-Bind,"Identifying novel drug-target interactions is a critical and rate-limiting step in drug discovery. While deep learning models have been proposed to accelerate the identification process, here we show that state-of-the-art models fail to generalize to novel (i.e., never-before-seen) structures. We unveil the mechanisms responsible for this shortcoming, demonstrating how models rely on shortcuts that leverage the topology of the protein-ligand bipartite network, rather than learning the node features. Here we introduce AI-Bind, a pipeline that combines network-based sampling strategies with unsupervised pre-training to improve binding predictions for novel proteins and ligands. We validate AI-Bind predictions via docking simulations and comparison with recent experimental evidence, and step up the process of interpreting machine learning prediction of protein-ligand binding by identifying potential active binding sites on the amino acid sequence. AI-Bind is a high-throughput approach to identify drug-target combinations with the potential of becoming a powerful tool in drug discovery."
579,Predicting compound activity from phenotypic profiles and chemical structures,"Predicting assay results for compounds virtually using chemical structures and phenotypic profiles has the potential to reduce the time and resources of screens for drug discovery. Here, we evaluate the relative strength of three high-throughput data sources—chemical structures, imaging (Cell Painting), and gene-expression profiles (L1000)—to predict compound bioactivity using a historical collection of 16,170 compounds tested in 270 assays for a total of 585,439 readouts. All three data modalities can predict compound activity for 6–10% of assays, and in combination they predict 21% of assays with high accuracy, which is a 2 to 3 times higher success rate than using a single modality alone. In practice, the accuracy of predictors could be lower and still be useful, increasing the assays that can be predicted from 37% with chemical structures alone up to 64% when combined with phenotypic data. Our study shows that unbiased phenotypic profiling can be leveraged to enhance compound bioactivity prediction to accelerate the early stages of the drug-discovery process."
580,SpaDecon: cell-type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics with semi-supervised learning,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has advanced our understanding of the spatial patterns of gene expression, but the lack of single-cell resolution in spatial barcoding-based SRT hinders the inference of specific locations of individual cells. To determine the spatial distribution of cell types in SRT, we present SpaDecon, a semi-supervised learning approach that incorporates gene expression, spatial location, and histology information for cell-type deconvolution. SpaDecon was evaluated through analyses of four real SRT datasets using knowledge of the expected distributions of cell types. Quantitative evaluations were performed for four pseudo-SRT datasets constructed according to benchmark proportions. Using mean squared error and Jensen-Shannon divergence with the benchmark proportions as evaluation criteria, we show that SpaDecon performance surpasses that of published cell-type deconvolution methods. Given the accuracy and computational speed of SpaDecon, we anticipate it will be valuable for SRT data analysis and will facilitate the integration of genomics and digital pathology."
581,Continuous millisecond conformational cycle of a DEAH box helicase reveals control of domain motions by atomic-scale transitions,"Helicases are motor enzymes found in every living organism and viruses, where they maintain the stability of the genome and control against false recombination. The DEAH-box helicase Prp43 plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing in unicellular organisms by translocating single-stranded RNA. The molecular mechanisms and conformational transitions of helicases are not understood at the atomic level. We present a complete conformational cycle of RNA translocation by Prp43 in atomic detail based on molecular dynamics simulations. To enable the sampling of such complex transition on the millisecond timescale, we combined two enhanced sampling techniques, namely simulated tempering and adaptive sampling guided by crystallographic data. During RNA translocation, the center-of-mass motions of the RecA-like domains followed the established inchworm model, whereas the domains crawled along the RNA in a caterpillar-like movement, suggesting an inchworm/caterpillar model. However, this crawling required a complex sequence of atomic-scale transitions involving the release of an arginine finger from the ATP pocket, stepping of the hook-loop and hook-turn motifs along the RNA backbone, and several others. These findings highlight that large-scale domain dynamics may be controlled by complex sequences of atomic-scale transitions."
582,CD-CODE: crowdsourcing condensate database and encyclopedia,"The discovery of biomolecular condensates transformed our understanding of intracellular compartmentalization of molecules. To integrate interdisciplinary scientific knowledge about the function and composition of biomolecular condensates, we developed the crowdsourcing condensate database and encyclopedia (
cd-code.org
). CD-CODE is a community-editable platform, which includes a database of biomolecular condensates based on the literature, an encyclopedia of relevant scientific terms and a crowdsourcing web application. Our platform will accelerate the discovery and validation of biomolecular condensates, and facilitate efforts to understand their role in disease and as therapeutic targets."
583,Automated optimisation of solubility and conformational stability of antibodies and proteins,"Biologics, such as antibodies and enzymes, are crucial in research, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Often, biologics with suitable functionality are discovered, but their development is impeded by developability issues. Stability and solubility are key biophysical traits underpinning developability potential, as they determine aggregation, correlate with production yield and poly-specificity, and are essential to access parenteral and oral delivery. While advances for the optimisation of individual traits have been made, the co-optimization of multiple traits remains highly problematic and time-consuming, as mutations that improve one property often negatively impact others. In this work, we introduce a fully automated computational strategy for the simultaneous optimisation of conformational stability and solubility, which we experimentally validate on six antibodies, including two approved therapeutics. Our results on 42 designs demonstrate that the computational procedure is highly effective at improving developability potential, while not affecting antigen-binding. We make the method available as a webserver at www-cohsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk."
584,Structural mechanism of a drug-binding process involving a large conformational change of the protein target,"Proteins often undergo large conformational changes when binding small molecules, but atomic-level descriptions of such events have been elusive. Here, we report unguided molecular dynamics simulations of Abl kinase binding to the cancer drug imatinib. In the simulations, imatinib first selectively engages Abl kinase in its autoinhibitory conformation. Consistent with inferences drawn from previous experimental studies, imatinib then induces a large conformational change of the protein to reach a bound complex that closely resembles published crystal structures. Moreover, the simulations reveal a surprising local structural instability in the C-terminal lobe of Abl kinase during binding. The unstable region includes a number of residues that, when mutated, confer imatinib resistance by an unknown mechanism. Based on the simulations, NMR spectra, hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements, and thermostability measurements and estimates, we suggest that these mutations confer imatinib resistance by exacerbating structural instability in the C-terminal lobe, rendering the imatinib-bound state energetically unfavorable."
585,"Etiology of oncogenic fusions in 5,190 childhood cancers and its clinical and therapeutic implication","Oncogenic fusions formed through chromosomal rearrangements are hallmarks of childhood cancer that define cancer subtype, predict outcome, persist through treatment, and can be ideal therapeutic targets. However, mechanistic understanding of the etiology of oncogenic fusions remains elusive. Here we report a comprehensive detection of 272 oncogenic fusion gene pairs by using tumor transcriptome sequencing data from 5190 childhood cancer patients. We identify diverse factors, including translation frame, protein domain, splicing, and gene length, that shape the formation of oncogenic fusions.

586,Buffering of transcription rate by mRNA half-life is a conserved feature of Rett syndrome models,"Transcriptional changes in Rett syndrome (RTT) are assumed to directly correlate with steady-state mRNA levels, but limited evidence in mice suggests that changes in transcription can be compensated by post-transcriptional regulation. We measure transcription rate and mRNA half-life changes in RTT patient neurons using RATEseq, and re-interpret nuclear and whole-cell RNAseq from 
Mecp2
 mice. Genes are dysregulated by changing transcription rate or half-life and are buffered when both change. We utilized classifier models to predict the direction of transcription rate changes and find that combined frequencies of three dinucleotides are better predictors than CA and CG. MicroRNA and RNA-binding Protein (RBP) motifs are enriched in 3ʹUTRs of genes with half-life changes. Nuclear RBP motifs are enriched on buffered genes with increased transcription rate. We identify post-transcriptional mechanisms in humans and mice that alter half-life or buffer transcription rate changes when a transcriptional modulator gene is mutated in a neurodevelopmental disorder."
587,"Systematic comparison of tools used for m
6
A mapping from nanopore direct RNA sequencing","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been increasingly recognized as a new and important regulator of gene expression. To date, transcriptome-wide m6A detection primarily relies on well-established methods using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. However, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform has recently emerged as a promising alternative method to study m6A. While multiple computational tools are being developed to facilitate the direct detection of nucleotide modifications, little is known about the capabilities and limitations of these tools. Here, we systematically compare ten tools used for mapping m6A from ONT DRS data. We find that most tools present a trade-off between precision and recall, and integrating results from multiple tools greatly improve performance. Using a negative control could improve precision by subtracting certain intrinsic bias. We also observed variation in detection capabilities and quantitative information among motifs, and identified sequencing depth and m6A stoichiometry as potential factors affecting performance. Our study provides insight into the computational tools currently used for mapping m6A based on ONT DRS data and highlights the potential for further improving these tools, which may serve as the basis for future research."
588,Structure-preserving visualization for single-cell RNA-Seq profiles using deep manifold transformation with batch-correction,"Dimensionality reduction and visualization play an important role in biological data analysis, such as data interpretation of single-cell RNA sequences (scRNA-seq). It is desired to have a visualization method that can not only be applicable to various application scenarios, including cell clustering and trajectory inference, but also satisfy a variety of technical requirements, especially the ability to preserve inherent structure of data and handle with batch effects. However, no existing methods can accommodate these requirements in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a general visualization method, deep visualization (DV), that possesses the ability to preserve inherent structure of data and handle batch effects and is applicable to a variety of datasets from different application domains and dataset scales. The method embeds a given dataset into a 2- or 3-dimensional visualization space, with either a Euclidean or hyperbolic metric depending on a specified task type with type 
static
 (at a time point) or 
dynamic
 (at a sequence of time points) scRNA-seq data, respectively. Specifically, DV learns a structure graph to describe the relationships between data samples, transforms the data into visualization space while preserving the geometric structure of the data and correcting batch effects in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results on nine datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development demonstrate the competitiveness of DV in discovering complex cellular relations, uncovering temporal trajectories, and addressing complex batch factors. We also provide a preliminary attempt to pre-train a DV model for visualization of new incoming data."
589,Habit formation viewed as structural change in the behavioral network,"Habit formation is a process in which an action becomes involuntary. While goal-directed behavior is driven by its consequences, habits are elicited by a situation rather than its consequences. Existing theories have proposed that actions are controlled by corresponding two distinct systems. Although canonical theories based on such distinctions are starting to be challenged, there are a few theoretical frameworks that implement goal-directed behavior and habits within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theoretical framework by hypothesizing that behavior is a network composed of several responses. With this framework, we have shown that the transition of goal-directed actions to habits is caused by a change in a single network structure. Furthermore, we confirmed that the proposed network model behaves in a manner consistent with the existing experimental results reported in animal behavioral studies. Our results revealed that habit could be formed under the control of a single system rather than two distinct systems. By capturing the behavior as a single network change, this framework provides a new perspective on studying the structure of the behavior for experimental and theoretical research."
590,Cellcano: supervised cell type identification for single cell ATAC-seq data,"Computational cell type identification is a fundamental step in single-cell omics data analysis. Supervised celltyping methods have gained increasing popularity in single-cell RNA-seq data because of the superior performance and the availability of high-quality reference datasets. Recent technological advances in profiling chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution (scATAC-seq) have brought new insights to the understanding of epigenetic heterogeneity. With continuous accumulation of scATAC-seq datasets, supervised celltyping method specifically designed for scATAC-seq is in urgent need. Here we develop Cellcano, a computational method based on a two-round supervised learning algorithm to identify cell types from scATAC-seq data. The method alleviates the distributional shift between reference and target data and improves the prediction performance. After systematically benchmarking Cellcano on 50 well-designed celltyping tasks from various datasets, we show that Cellcano is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. Cellcano is well-documented and freely available at

591,The CellPhe toolkit for cell phenotyping using time-lapse imaging and pattern recognition,"With phenotypic heterogeneity in whole cell populations widely recognised, the demand for quantitative and temporal analysis approaches to characterise single cell morphology and dynamics has increased. We present CellPhe, a pattern recognition toolkit for the unbiased characterisation of cellular phenotypes within time-lapse videos. CellPhe imports tracking information from multiple segmentation and tracking algorithms to provide automated cell phenotyping from different imaging modalities, including fluorescence. To maximise data quality for downstream analysis, our toolkit includes automated recognition and removal of erroneous cell boundaries induced by inaccurate tracking and segmentation. We provide an extensive list of features extracted from individual cell time series, with custom feature selection to identify variables that provide greatest discrimination for the analysis in question. Using ensemble classification for accurate prediction of cellular phenotype and clustering algorithms for the characterisation of heterogeneous subsets, we validate and prove adaptability using different cell types and experimental conditions."
592,Rapid detection of neurons in widefield calcium imaging datasets after training with synthetic data,"Widefield microscopy can provide optical access to multi-millimeter fields of view and thousands of neurons in mammalian brains at video rate. However, tissue scattering and background contamination results in signal deterioration, making the extraction of neuronal activity challenging, laborious and time consuming. Here we present our deep-learning-based widefield neuron finder (DeepWonder), which is trained by simulated functional recordings and effectively works on experimental data to achieve high-fidelity neuronal extraction. Equipped with systematic background contribution priors, DeepWonder conducts neuronal inference with an order-of-magnitude-faster speed and improved accuracy compared with alternative approaches. DeepWonder removes background contaminations and is computationally efficient. Specifically, DeepWonder accomplishes 50-fold signal-to-background ratio enhancement when processing terabytes-scale cortex-wide functional recordings, with over 14,000 neurons extracted in 17 h."
593,Comparative analysis of dimension reduction methods for cytometry by time-of-flight data,"While experimental and informatic techniques around single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) are advanced, research around mass cytometry (CyTOF) data analysis has severely lagged behind. CyTOF data are notably different from scRNA-seq data in many aspects. This calls for the evaluation and development of computational methods specific for CyTOF data. Dimension reduction (DR) is one of the critical steps of single cell data analysis. Here, we benchmark the performances of 21 DR methods on 110 real and 425 synthetic CyTOF samples. We find that less well-known methods like SAUCIE, SQuaD-MDS, and scvis are the overall best performers. In particular, SAUCIE and scvis are well balanced, SQuaD-MDS excels at structure preservation, whereas UMAP has great downstream analysis performance. We also find that t-SNE (along with SQuad-MDS/t-SNE Hybrid) possesses the best local structure preservation. Nevertheless, there is a high level of complementarity between these tools, so the choice of method should depend on the underlying data structure and the analytical needs."
594,Spatial probabilistic mapping of metabolite ensembles in mass spectrometry imaging,"Mass spectrometry imaging vows to enable simultaneous spatially resolved investigation of hundreds of metabolites in tissues, but it primarily relies on traditional ion images for non-data-driven metabolite visualization and analysis. The rendering and interpretation of ion images neither considers nonlinearities in the resolving power of mass spectrometers nor does it yet evaluate the statistical significance of differential spatial metabolite abundance. Here, we outline the computational framework moleculaR (
https://github.com/CeMOS-Mannheim/moleculaR
) that is expected to improve signal reliability by data-dependent Gaussian-weighting of ion intensities and that introduces probabilistic molecular mapping of statistically significant nonrandom patterns of relative spatial abundance of metabolites-of-interest in tissue. moleculaR also enables cross-tissue statistical comparisons and collective molecular projections of entire biomolecular ensembles followed by their spatial statistical significance evaluation on a single tissue plane. It thereby fosters the spatially resolved investigation of ion milieus, lipid remodeling pathways, or complex scores like the adenylate energy charge within the same image."
595,Signatures of T cell immunity revealed using sequence similarity with TCRDivER algorithm,"Changes in the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires have become important markers for monitoring disease or therapy progression. With the rise of immunotherapy usage in cancer, infectious and autoimmune disease, accurate assessment and comparison of the “state"" of the TCR repertoire has become paramount. One important driver of change within the repertoire is T cell proliferation following immunisation. A way of monitoring this is by investigating large clones of individual T cells believed to bind epitopes connected to the disease. However, as a single target can be bound by many different TCRs, monitoring individual clones cannot fully account for T cell cross-reactivity. Moreover, T cells responding to the same target often exhibit higher sequence similarity, which highlights the importance of accounting for TCR similarity within the repertoire. This complexity of binding relationships between a TCR and its target convolutes comparison of immune responses between individuals or comparisons of TCR repertoires at different timepoints. Here we propose TCRDivER algorithm (T cell Receptor Diversity Estimates for Repertoires), a global method of T cell repertoire comparison using diversity profiles sensitive to both clone size and sequence similarity. This approach allowed for distinction between spleen TCR repertoires of immunised and non-immunised mice, showing the need for including both facets of repertoire changes simultaneously. The analysis revealed biologically interpretable relationships between sequence similarity and clonality. These aid in understanding differences and separation of repertoires stemming from different biological context. With the rise of availability of sequencing data we expect our tool to find broad usage in clinical and research applications."
596,Bayesian stroke modeling details sex biases in the white matter substrates of aphasia,"Ischemic cerebrovascular events often lead to aphasia. Previous work provided hints that such strokes may affect women and men in distinct ways. Women tend to suffer strokes with more disabling language impairment, even if the lesion size is comparable to men. In 1401 patients, we isolate data-led representations of anatomical lesion patterns and hand-tailor a Bayesian analytical solution to carefully model the degree of sex divergence in predicting language outcomes ~3 months after stroke. We locate lesion-outcome effects in the left-dominant language network that highlight the ventral pathway as a core lesion focus across different tests of language performance. We provide detailed evidence for sex-specific brain-behavior associations in the domain-general networks associated with cortico-subcortical pathways, with unique contributions of the fornix in women and cingular fiber bundles in men. Our collective findings suggest diverging white matter substrates in how stroke causes language deficits in women and men. Clinically acknowledging such sex disparities has the potential to improve personalized treatment for stroke patients worldwide."
597,A mass spectrum-oriented computational method for ion mobility-resolved untargeted metabolomics,"Ion mobility (IM) adds a new dimension to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics which significantly enhances coverage, sensitivity, and resolving power for analyzing the metabolome, particularly metabolite isomers. However, the high dimensionality of IM-resolved metabolomics data presents a great challenge to data processing, restricting its widespread applications. Here, we develop a mass spectrum-oriented bottom-up assembly algorithm for IM-resolved metabolomics that utilizes mass spectra to assemble four-dimensional peaks in a reverse order of multidimensional separation. We further develop the end-to-end computational framework Met4DX for peak detection, quantification and identification of metabolites in IM-resolved metabolomics. Benchmarking and validation of Met4DX demonstrates superior performance compared to existing tools with regard to coverage, sensitivity, peak fidelity and quantification precision. Importantly, Met4DX successfully detects and differentiates co-eluted metabolite isomers with small differences in the chromatographic and IM dimensions. Together, Met4DX advances metabolite discovery in biological organisms by deciphering the complex 4D metabolomics data."
598,ERnet: a tool for the semantic segmentation and quantitative analysis of endoplasmic reticulum topology,"The ability to quantify structural changes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for understanding the structure and function of this organelle. However, the rapid movement and complex topology of ER networks make this challenging. Here, we construct a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method that we call ERnet for the automatic classification of sheet and tubular ER domains inside individual cells. Data are skeletonized and represented by connectivity graphs, enabling precise and efficient quantification of network connectivity. ERnet generates metrics on topology and integrity of ER structures and quantifies structural change in response to genetic or metabolic manipulation. We validate ERnet using data obtained by various ER-imaging methods from different cell types as well as ground truth images of synthetic ER structures. ERnet can be deployed in an automatic high-throughput and unbiased fashion and identifies subtle changes in ER phenotypes that may inform on disease progression and response to therapy."
599,Virome-wide detection of natural infection events and the associated antibody dynamics using longitudinal highly-multiplexed serology,"Current methods for detecting infections either require a sample collected from an actively infected site, are limited in the number of agents they can query, and/or yield no information on the immune response. Here we present an approach that uses temporally coordinated changes in highly-multiplexed antibody measurements from longitudinal blood samples to monitor infection events at sub-species resolution across the human virome. In a longitudinally-sampled cohort of South African adolescents representing >100 person-years, we identify >650 events across 48 virus species and observe strong epidemic effects, including high-incidence waves of 
Aichivirus A
 and the D68 subtype of 
Enterovirus D
 earlier than their widespread circulation was appreciated. In separate cohorts of adults who were sampled at higher frequency using self-collected dried blood spots, we show that such events temporally correlate with symptoms and transient inflammatory biomarker elevations, and observe the responding antibodies to persist for periods ranging from ≤1 week to >5 years. Our approach generates a rich view of viral/host dynamics, supporting novel studies in immunology and epidemiology."
600,"MS2Query: reliable and scalable MS
2
 mass spectra-based analogue search","Metabolomics-driven discoveries of biological samples remain hampered by the grand challenge of metabolite annotation and identification. Only few metabolites have an annotated spectrum in spectral libraries; hence, searching only for exact library matches generally returns a few hits. An attractive alternative is searching for so-called analogues as a starting point for structural annotations; analogues are library molecules which are not exact matches but display a high chemical similarity. However, current analogue search implementations are not yet very reliable and relatively slow. Here, we present MS2Query, a machine learning-based tool that integrates mass spectral embedding-based chemical similarity predictors (Spec2Vec and MS2Deepscore) as well as detected precursor masses to rank potential analogues and exact matches. Benchmarking MS2Query on reference mass spectra and experimental case studies demonstrate improved reliability and scalability. Thereby, MS2Query offers exciting opportunities to further increase the annotation rate of metabolomics profiles of complex metabolite mixtures and to discover new biology."
601,Genetic variation in cis-regulatory domains suggests cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms in immunity,"Studying the interplay between genetic variation, epigenetic changes, and regulation of gene expression is crucial to understand the modification of cellular states in various conditions, including immune diseases. In this study, we characterize the cell-specificity in three key cells of the human immune system by building cis maps of regulatory regions with coordinated activity (CRDs) from ChIP-seq peaks and methylation data. We find that only 33% of CRD-gene associations are shared between cell types, revealing how similarly located regulatory regions provide cell-specific modulation of gene activity. We emphasize important biological mechanisms, as most of our associations are enriched in cell-specific transcription factor binding sites, blood-traits, and immune disease-associated loci. Notably, we show that CRD-QTLs aid in interpreting GWAS findings and help prioritize variants for testing functional hypotheses within human complex diseases. Additionally, we map trans CRD regulatory associations, and among 207 trans-eQTLs discovered, 46 overlap with the QTLGen Consortium meta-analysis in whole blood, showing that mapping functional regulatory units using population genomics allows discovering important mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression in immune cells. Finally, we constitute a comprehensive resource describing multi-omics changes to gain a greater understanding of cell-type specific regulatory mechanisms of immunity."
602,Deep learning-enabled segmentation of ambiguous bioimages with deepflash2,"Bioimages frequently exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios due to experimental conditions, specimen characteristics, and imaging trade-offs. Reliable segmentation of such ambiguous images is difficult and laborious. Here we introduce deepflash2, a deep learning-enabled segmentation tool for bioimage analysis. The tool addresses typical challenges that may arise during the training, evaluation, and application of deep learning models on ambiguous data. The tool’s training and evaluation pipeline uses multiple expert annotations and deep model ensembles to achieve accurate results. The application pipeline supports various use-cases for expert annotations and includes a quality assurance mechanism in the form of uncertainty measures. Benchmarked against other tools, deepflash2 offers both high predictive accuracy and efficient computational resource usage. The tool is built upon established deep learning libraries and enables sharing of trained model ensembles with the research community. deepflash2 aims to simplify the integration of deep learning into bioimage analysis projects while improving accuracy and reliability."
603,High-speed low-light in vivo two-photon voltage imaging of large neuronal populations,"Monitoring spiking activity across large neuronal populations at behaviorally relevant timescales is critical for understanding neural circuit function. Unlike calcium imaging, voltage imaging requires kilohertz sampling rates that reduce fluorescence detection to near shot-noise levels. High-photon flux excitation can overcome photon-limited shot noise, but photobleaching and photodamage restrict the number and duration of simultaneously imaged neurons. We investigated an alternative approach aimed at low two-photon flux, which is voltage imaging below the shot-noise limit. This framework involved developing positive-going voltage indicators with improved spike detection (SpikeyGi and SpikeyGi2); a two-photon microscope (‘SMURF’) for kilohertz frame rate imaging across a 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm field of view; and a self-supervised denoising algorithm (DeepVID) for inferring fluorescence from shot-noise-limited signals. Through these combined advances, we achieved simultaneous high-speed deep-tissue imaging of more than 100 densely labeled neurons over 1 hour in awake behaving mice. This demonstrates a scalable approach for voltage imaging across increasing neuronal populations."
604,A comprehensive platform for analyzing longitudinal multi-omics data,"Longitudinal bulk and single-cell omics data is increasingly generated for biological and clinical research but is challenging to analyze due to its many intrinsic types of variations. We present PALMO (
https://github.com/aifimmunology/PALMO
), a platform that contains five analytical modules to examine longitudinal bulk and single-cell multi-omics data from multiple perspectives, including decomposition of sources of variations within the data, collection of stable or variable features across timepoints and participants, identification of up- or down-regulated markers across timepoints of individual participants, and investigation on samples of same participants for possible outlier events. We have tested PALMO performance on a complex longitudinal multi-omics dataset of five data modalities on the same samples and six external datasets of diverse background. Both PALMO and our longitudinal multi-omics dataset can be valuable resources to the scientific community."
605,Functional comparison of metabolic networks across species,"Metabolic phenotypes are pivotal for many areas, but disentangling how evolutionary history and environmental adaptation shape these phenotypes is an open problem. Especially for microbes, which are metabolically diverse and often interact in complex communities, few phenotypes can be determined directly. Instead, potential phenotypes are commonly inferred from genomic information, and rarely were model-predicted phenotypes employed beyond the species level. Here, we propose sensitivity correlations to quantify similarity of predicted metabolic network responses to perturbations, and thereby link genotype and environment to phenotype. We show that these correlations provide a consistent functional complement to genomic information by capturing how network context shapes gene function. This enables, for example, phylogenetic inference across all domains of life at the organism level. For 245 bacterial species, we identify conserved and variable metabolic functions, elucidate the quantitative impact of evolutionary history and ecological niche on these functions, and generate hypotheses on associated metabolic phenotypes. We expect our framework for the joint interpretation of metabolic phenotypes, evolution, and environment to help guide future empirical studies."
606,Lacking mechanistic disease definitions and corresponding association data hamper progress in network medicine and beyond,"A long-term objective of network medicine is to replace our current, mainly phenotype-based disease definitions by subtypes of health conditions corresponding to distinct pathomechanisms. For this, molecular and health data are modeled as networks and are mined for pathomechanisms. However, many such studies rely on large-scale disease association data where diseases are annotated using the very phenotype-based disease definitions the network medicine field aims to overcome. This raises the question to which extent the biases mechanistically inadequate disease annotations introduce in disease association data distort the results of studies which use such data for pathomechanism mining. We address this question using global- and local-scale analyses of networks constructed from disease association data of various types. Our results indicate that large-scale disease association data should be used with care for pathomechanism mining and that analyses of such data should be accompanied by close-up analyses of molecular data for well-characterized patient cohorts."
607,Multi-modal quantification of pathway activity with MAYA,"Signaling pathways can be activated through various cascades of genes depending on cell identity and biological context. Single-cell atlases now provide the opportunity to inspect such complexity in health and disease. Yet, existing reference tools for pathway scoring resume activity of each pathway to one unique common metric across cell types. Here, we present MAYA, a computational method that enables the automatic detection and scoring of the diverse modes of activation of biological pathways across cell populations. MAYA improves the granularity of pathway analysis by detecting subgroups of genes within reference pathways, each characteristic of a cell population and how it activates a pathway. Using multiple single-cell datasets, we demonstrate the biological relevance of identified modes of activation, the robustness of MAYA to noisy pathway lists and batch effect. MAYA can also predict cell types starting from lists of reference markers in a cluster-free manner. Finally, we show that MAYA reveals common modes of pathway activation in tumor cells across patients, opening the perspective to discover shared therapeutic vulnerabilities."
608,Evidence for wastewaters as environments where mobile antibiotic resistance genes emerge,"The emergence and spread of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in pathogens have become a serious threat to global health. Still little is known about where ARGs gain mobility in the first place. Here, we aimed to collect evidence indicating where such initial mobilization events of clinically relevant ARGs may have occurred. We found that the majority of previously identified origin species did not carry the mobilizing elements that likely enabled intracellular mobility of the ARGs, suggesting a necessary interplay between different bacteria. Analyses of a broad range of metagenomes revealed that wastewaters and wastewater-impacted environments had by far the highest abundance of both origin species and corresponding mobilizing elements. Most origin species were only occasionally detected in other environments. Co-occurrence of origin species and corresponding mobilizing elements were rare in human microbiota. Our results identify wastewaters and wastewater-impacted environments as plausible arenas for the initial mobilization of resistance genes."
609,Clonal origin and development of high hyperdiploidy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HeH ALL), one of the most common childhood malignancies, is driven by nonrandom aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome numbers) mainly comprising chromosomal gains. In this study, we investigate how aneuploidy in HeH ALL arises. Single cell whole genome sequencing of 2847 cells from nine primary cases and one normal bone marrow reveals that HeH ALL generally display low chromosomal heterogeneity, indicating that they are not characterized by chromosomal instability and showing that aneuploidy-driven malignancies are not necessarily chromosomally heterogeneous. Furthermore, most chromosomal gains are present in all leukemic cells, suggesting that they arose early during leukemogenesis. Copy number data from 577 primary cases reveals selective pressures that were used for in silico modeling of aneuploidy development. This shows that the aneuploidy in HeH ALL likely arises by an initial tripolar mitosis in a diploid cell followed by clonal evolution, in line with a punctuated evolution model."
610,Transmission modeling to infer tuberculosis incidence prevalence and mortality in settings with generalized HIV epidemics,"Tuberculosis (TB) killed more people globally than any other single pathogen over the past decade. Where surveillance is weak, estimating TB burden estimates uses modeling. In many African countries, increases in HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy have driven dynamic TB epidemics, complicating estimation of burden, trends, and potential intervention impact. We therefore develop a novel age-structured TB transmission model incorporating evolving demographic, HIV and antiretroviral therapy effects, and calibrate to TB prevalence and notification data from 12 African countries. We use Bayesian methods to include uncertainty for all TB model parameters, and estimate age-specific annual risks of TB infection, finding up to 16.0%/year in adults, and the proportion of TB incidence from recent (re)infection, finding a mean across countries of 34%. Rapid reduction of the unacceptably high burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings will require interventions addressing progression as well as transmission."
611,Predicting vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 over time and against variants: a meta-analysis,"Vaccine protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to be strongly correlated with neutralising antibody titres; however, this has not yet been demonstrated for severe COVID-19. To explore whether this relationship also holds for severe COVID-19, we performed a systematic search for studies reporting on protection against different SARS-CoV-2 clinical endpoints and extracted data from 15 studies. Since matched neutralising antibody titres were not available, we used the vaccine regimen, time since vaccination and variant of concern to predict corresponding neutralising antibody titres. We then compared the observed vaccine effectiveness reported in these studies to the protection predicted by a previously published model of the relationship between neutralising antibody titre and vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19. We find that predicted neutralising antibody titres are strongly correlated with observed vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic (Spearman 
\(\rho\)
 = 0.95, 
p
 < 0.001) and severe (Spearman 
\(\rho\)
 = 0.72, 
p
 < 0.001 for both) COVID-19 and that the loss of neutralising antibodies over time and to new variants are strongly predictive of observed vaccine protection against severe COVID-19."
612,Cue: a deep-learning framework for structural variant discovery and genotyping,"Structural variants (SVs) are a major driver of genetic diversity and disease in the human genome and their discovery is imperative to advances in precision medicine. Existing SV callers rely on hand-engineered features and heuristics to model SVs, which cannot scale to the vast diversity of SVs nor fully harness the information available in sequencing datasets. Here we propose an extensible deep-learning framework, Cue, to call and genotype SVs that can learn complex SV abstractions directly from the data. At a high level, Cue converts alignments to images that encode SV-informative signals and uses a stacked hourglass convolutional neural network to predict the type, genotype and genomic locus of the SVs captured in each image. We show that Cue outperforms the state of the art in the detection of several classes of SVs on synthetic and real short-read data and that it can be easily extended to other sequencing platforms, while achieving competitive performance."
613,Pan-cancer classification of single cells in the tumour microenvironment,"Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity within tumour microenvironments (TMEs), paving the way for a deep understanding of cellular mechanisms contributing to cancer. However, high heterogeneity among the same cancer types and low transcriptomic variation in immune cell subsets present challenges for accurate, high-resolution confirmation of cells’ identities. Here we present scATOMIC; a modular annotation tool for malignant and non-malignant cells. We trained scATOMIC on >300,000 cancer, immune, and stromal cells defining a pan-cancer reference across 19 common cancers and employ a hierarchical approach, outperforming current classification methods. We extensively confirm scATOMIC’s accuracy on 225 tumour biopsies encompassing >350,000 cancer and a variety of TME cells. Lastly, we demonstrate scATOMIC’s practical significance to accurately subset breast cancers into clinically relevant subtypes and predict tumours’ primary origin across metastatic cancers. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyse multicellular cancer TMEs."
614,Interoperable slide microscopy viewer and annotation tool for imaging data science and computational pathology,"The exchange of large and complex slide microscopy imaging data in biomedical research and pathology practice is impeded by a lack of data standardization and interoperability, which is detrimental to the reproducibility of scientific findings and clinical integration of technological innovations. We introduce Slim, an open-source, web-based slide microscopy viewer that implements the internationally accepted Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard to achieve interoperability with a multitude of existing medical imaging systems. We showcase the capabilities of Slim as the slide microscopy viewer of the NCI Imaging Data Commons and demonstrate how the viewer enables interactive visualization of traditional brightfield microscopy and highly-multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy images from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Human Tissue Atlas Network, respectively, using standard DICOMweb services. We further show how Slim enables the collection of standardized image annotations for the development or validation of machine learning models and the visual interpretation of model inference results in the form of segmentation masks, spatial heat maps, or image-derived measurements."
615,Integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data for the discovery of splice-associated variants in cancer,"Somatic mutations within non-coding regions and even exons may have unidentified regulatory consequences that are often overlooked in analysis workflows. Here we present RegTools (
www.regtools.org
), a computationally efficient, free, and open-source software package designed to integrate somatic variants from genomic data with splice junctions from bulk or single cell transcriptomic data to identify variants that may cause aberrant splicing. We apply RegTools to over 9000 tumor samples with both tumor DNA and RNA sequence data. RegTools discovers 235,778 events where a splice-associated variant significantly increases the splicing of a particular junction, across 158,200 unique variants and 131,212 unique junctions. To characterize these somatic variants and their associated splice isoforms, we annotate them with the Variant Effect Predictor, SpliceAI, and Genotype-Tissue Expression junction counts and compare our results to other tools that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data. While many events are corroborated by the aforementioned tools, the flexibility of RegTools also allows us to identify splice-associated variants in known cancer drivers, such as 
TP53
, 
CDKN2A
, and 
B2M
, and other genes."
616,Assessment of community efforts to advance network-based prediction of protein–protein interactions,"Comprehensive understanding of the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, aka the human interactome, can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex biological processes and diseases. Despite the remarkable experimental efforts undertaken to date to determine the structure of the human interactome, many PPIs remain unmapped. Computational approaches, especially network-based methods, can facilitate the identification of previously uncharacterized PPIs. Many such methods have been proposed. Yet, a systematic evaluation of existing network-based methods in predicting PPIs is still lacking. Here, we report community efforts initiated by the International Network Medicine Consortium to benchmark the ability of 26 representative network-based methods to predict PPIs across six different interactomes of four different organisms: 
A. thaliana
, 
C. elegans
, 
S. cerevisiae
, and 
H. sapiens
. Through extensive computational and experimental validations, we found that advanced similarity-based methods, which leverage the underlying network characteristics of PPIs, show superior performance over other general link prediction methods in the interactomes we considered."
617,Decoupling body shape and mass distribution in birds and their dinosaurian ancestors,"It is accepted that non-avian theropod dinosaurs, with their long muscular tails and small forelimbs, had a centre-of-mass close to the hip, while extant birds, with their reduced tails and enlarged wings have their mass centred more cranially. Transition between these states is considered crucial to two key innovations in the avian locomotor system: crouched bipedalism and powered flight. Here we use image-based models to challenge this dichotomy. Rather than a phylogenetic distinction between ‘dinosaurian’ and ‘avian’ conditions, we find terrestrial versus volant taxa occupy distinct regions of centre-of-mass morphospace consistent with the disparate demands of terrestrial bipedalism and flight. We track this decoupled evolution of body shape and mass distribution through bird evolution, including the origin of centre-of-mass positions more advantageous for flight and major reversions coincident with terrestriality. We recover modularity in the evolution of limb proportions and centre-of-mass that suggests fully crouched bipedalism evolved after powered flight."
618,Insights into receptor structure and dynamics at the surface of living cells,"Evaluating protein structures in living cells remains a challenge. Here, we investigate Interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) into which the non-canonical amino acid bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne-lysine (BCNK) is incorporated by genetic code expansion. Bioorthogonal click labeling is performed with tetrazine-conjugated dyes. To quantify the reaction yield in situ, we develop brightness-calibrated ratiometric imaging, a protocol where fluorescent signals in confocal multi-color images are ascribed to local concentrations. Screening receptor mutants bearing BCNK in the extracellular domain uncovered site-specific variations of both click efficiency and Interleukin-4 binding affinity, indicating subtle well-defined structural perturbations. Molecular dynamics and continuum electrostatics calculations suggest solvent polarization to determine site-specific variations of BCNK reactivity. Strikingly, signatures of differential click efficiency, measured for IL-4Rα in ligand-bound and free form, mirror sub-angstrom deformations of the protein backbone at corresponding locations. Thus, click efficiency by itself represents a remarkably informative readout linked to protein structure and dynamics in the native plasma membrane."
619,A comprehensive benchmarking with practical guidelines for cellular deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics technologies are used to profile transcriptomes while preserving spatial information, which enables high-resolution characterization of transcriptional patterns and reconstruction of tissue architecture. Due to the existence of low-resolution spots in recent spatial transcriptomics technologies, uncovering cellular heterogeneity is crucial for disentangling the spatial patterns of cell types, and many related methods have been proposed. Here, we benchmark 18 existing methods resolving a cellular deconvolution task with 50 real-world and simulated datasets by evaluating the accuracy, robustness, and usability of the methods. We compare these methods comprehensively using different metrics, resolutions, spatial transcriptomics technologies, spot numbers, and gene numbers. In terms of performance, CARD, Cell2location, and Tangram are the best methods for conducting the cellular deconvolution task. To refine our comparative results, we provide decision-tree-style guidelines and recommendations for method selection and their additional features, which will help users easily choose the best method for fulfilling their concerns."
620,Benchmarking integration of single-cell differential expression,"Integration of single-cell RNA sequencing data between different samples has been a major challenge for analyzing cell populations. However, strategies to integrate differential expression analysis of single-cell data remain underinvestigated. Here, we benchmark 46 workflows for differential expression analysis of single-cell data with multiple batches. We show that batch effects, sequencing depth and data sparsity substantially impact their performances. Notably, we find that the use of batch-corrected data rarely improves the analysis for sparse data, whereas batch covariate modeling improves the analysis for substantial batch effects. We show that for low depth data, single-cell techniques based on zero-inflation model deteriorate the performance, whereas the analysis of uncorrected data using limmatrend, Wilcoxon test and fixed effects model performs well. We suggest several high-performance methods under different conditions based on various simulation and real data analyses. Additionally, we demonstrate that differential expression analysis for a specific cell type outperforms that of large-scale bulk sample data in prioritizing disease-related genes."
621,Clinical and genetic associations of deep learning-derived cardiac magnetic resonance-based left ventricular mass,"Left ventricular mass is a risk marker for cardiovascular events, and may indicate an underlying cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance is the gold-standard for left ventricular mass estimation, but is challenging to obtain at scale. Here, we use deep learning to enable genome-wide association study of cardiac magnetic resonance-derived left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area within 43,230 UK Biobank participants. We identify 12 genome-wide associations (1 known at 
TTN
 and 11 novel for left ventricular mass), implicating genes previously associated with cardiac contractility and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance-derived indexed left ventricular mass is associated with incident dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant. An indexed left ventricular mass polygenic risk score ≥90
th
 percentile is also associated with incident implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant in separate UK Biobank (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.44) and Mass General Brigham (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.74) samples. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of cardiac magnetic resonance-derived indexed left ventricular mass to identify 11 novel variants and demonstrate that cardiac magnetic resonance-derived and genetically predicted indexed left ventricular mass are associated with incident cardiomyopathy."
622,Robust automated backbone triple resonance NMR assignments of proteins using Bayesian-based simulated annealing,"Assignment of resonances of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra to specific atoms within a protein remains a labor-intensive and challenging task. Automation of the assignment process often remains a bottleneck in the exploitation of solution NMR spectroscopy for the study of protein structure-dynamics-function relationships. We present an approach to the assignment of backbone triple resonance spectra of proteins. A Bayesian statistical analysis of predicted and observed chemical shifts is used in conjunction with inter-spin connectivities provided by triple resonance spectroscopy to calculate a pseudo-energy potential that drives a simulated annealing search for the most optimal set of resonance assignments. Termed Bayesian Assisted Assignments by Simulated Annealing (BARASA), a C++ program implementation is tested against systems ranging in size to over 450 amino acids including examples of intrinsically disordered proteins. BARASA is fast, robust, accommodates incomplete and incorrect information, and outperforms current algorithms – especially in cases of sparse data and is sufficiently fast to allow for real-time evaluation during data acquisition."
623,Dissociation between phase and power correlation networks in the human brain is driven by co-occurrent bursts,"Well-known haemodynamic resting-state networks are better mirrored in power correlation networks than phase coupling networks in electrophysiological data. However, what do these power correlation networks reflect? We address this long-outstanding question in neuroscience using rigorous mathematical analysis, biophysical simulations with ground truth and application of these mathematical concepts to empirical magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Our mathematical derivations show that for two non-Gaussian electrophysiological signals, their power correlation depends on their coherence, cokurtosis and conjugate-coherence. Only coherence and cokurtosis contribute to power correlation networks in MEG data, but cokurtosis is less affected by artefactual signal leakage and better mirrors haemodynamic resting-state networks. Simulations and MEG data show that cokurtosis may reflect co-occurrent bursting events. Our findings shed light on the origin of the complementary nature of power correlation networks to phase coupling networks and suggests that the origin of resting-state networks is partly reflected in co-occurent bursts in neuronal activity."
624,A dynamic clamping approach using in silico IK1 current for discrimination of chamber-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CM) constitute a mixed population of ventricular-, atrial-, nodal-like cells, limiting the reliability for studying chamber-specific disease mechanisms. Previous studies characterised CM phenotype based on action potential (AP) morphology, but the classification criteria were still undefined. Our aim was to use in silico models to develop an automated approach for discriminating the electrophysiological differences between hiPSC-CM. We propose the dynamic clamp (DC) technique with the injection of a specific I
K1
 current as a tool for deriving nine electrical biomarkers and blindly classifying differentiated CM. An unsupervised learning algorithm was applied to discriminate CM phenotypes and principal component analysis was used to visualise cell clustering. Pharmacological validation was performed by specific ion channel blocker and receptor agonist. The proposed approach improves the translational relevance of the hiPSC-CM model for studying mechanisms underlying inherited or acquired atrial arrhythmias in human CM, and for screening anti-arrhythmic agents."
625,Data integration across conditions improves turnover number estimates and metabolic predictions,"Turnover numbers characterize a key property of enzymes, and their usage in constraint-based metabolic modeling is expected to increase the prediction accuracy of diverse cellular phenotypes. In vivo turnover numbers can be obtained by integrating reaction rate and enzyme abundance measurements from individual experiments. Yet, their contribution to improving predictions of condition-specific cellular phenotypes remains elusive. Here, we show that available in vitro and in vivo turnover numbers lead to poor prediction of condition-specific growth rates with protein-constrained models of 
Escherichia coli
 and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
, particularly when protein abundances are considered. We demonstrate that correction of turnover numbers by simultaneous consideration of proteomics and physiological data leads to improved predictions of condition-specific growth rates. Moreover, the obtained estimates are more precise than corresponding in vitro turnover numbers. Therefore, our approach provides the means to correct turnover numbers and paves the way towards cataloguing kcatomes of other organisms."
626,Targeting Ras-binding domain of ELMO1 by computational nanobody design,"The control of cell movement through manipulation of cytoskeletal structure has therapeutic prospects notably in the development of novel anti-metastatic drugs. In this study, we determine the structure of Ras-binding domain (RBD) of ELMO1, a protein involved in cytoskeletal regulation, both alone and in complex with the activator RhoG and verify its targetability through computational nanobody design. Using our dock-and-design approach optimized with native-like initial pose selection, we obtain Nb01, a detectable binder from scratch in the first-round design. An affinity maturation step guided by structure-activity relationship at the interface generates 23 Nb01 sequence variants and 17 of them show enhanced binding to ELMO1-RBD and are modeled to form major spatial overlaps with RhoG. The best binder, Nb29, inhibited ELMO1-RBD/RhoG interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation of the flexibility of CDR2 and CDR3 of Nb29 reveal the design of stabilizing mutations at the CDR-framework junctions potentially confers the affinity enhancement."
627,Opposite effects of positive and negative symptoms on resting-state brain networks in schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by positive and negative symptoms, but their neural bases remain poorly understood. Here, we utilized a nested-spectral partition (NSP) approach to detect hierarchical modules in resting-state brain functional networks in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, and we studied dynamic transitions of segregation and integration as well as their relationships with clinical symptoms. Schizophrenia brains showed a more stable integrating process and a more variable segregating process, thus maintaining higher segregation, especially in the limbic system. Hallucinations were associated with higher integration in attention systems, and avolition was related to a more variable segregating process in default-mode network (DMN) and control systems. In a machine-learning model, NSP-based features outperformed graph measures at predicting positive and negative symptoms. Multivariate analysis confirmed that positive and negative symptoms had opposite effects on dynamic segregation and integration of brain networks. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the effect of negative symptoms was related to autistic, aggressive and violent behavior; the effect of positive symptoms was associated with hyperammonemia and acidosis; and the interaction effect was correlated with abnormal motor function. Our findings could contribute to the development of more accurate diagnostic criteria for positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia."
628,Domain adaptation for supervised integration of scRNA-seq data,"Large-scale scRNA-seq studies typically generate data in batches, which often induce nontrivial batch effects that need to be corrected. Given the global efforts for building cell atlases and the increasing number of annotated scRNA-seq datasets accumulated, we propose a supervised strategy for scRNA-seq data integration called SIDA (
S
upervised 
I
ntegration using 
D
omain 
A
daptation), which uses the cell type annotations to guide the integration of diverse batches. The supervised strategy is based on domain adaptation that was initially proposed in the computer vision field. We demonstrate that SIDA is able to generate comprehensive reference datasets that lead to improved accuracy in automated cell type mapping analyses."
629,From a genome-wide screen of RNAi molecules against SARS-CoV-2 to a validated broad-spectrum and potent prophylaxis,"Expanding the arsenal of prophylactic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance, specifically those strategies that are resistant to antigenic drift in Spike. Here, we conducted a screen of over 16,000 RNAi triggers against the SARS-CoV-2 genome, using a massively parallel assay to identify hyper-potent siRNAs. We selected Ten candidates for in vitro validation and found five siRNAs that exhibited hyper-potent activity (IC50 < 20 pM) and strong blockade of infectivity in live-virus experiments. We further enhanced this activity by combinatorial pairing of the siRNA candidates and identified cocktails that were active against multiple types of variants of concern (VOC). We then examined over 2,000 possible mutations in the siRNA target sites by using saturation mutagenesis and confirmed broad protection of the leading cocktail against future variants. Finally, we demonstrated that intranasal administration of this siRNA cocktail effectively attenuates clinical signs and viral measures of disease in the gold-standard Syrian hamster model. Our results pave the way for the development of an additional layer of antiviral prophylaxis that is orthogonal to vaccines and monoclonal antibodies."
630,Integrated transcriptome study of the tumor microenvironment for treatment response prediction in male predominant hypopharyngeal carcinoma,"The efficacy of the first-line treatment for hypopharyngeal carcinoma (HPC), a predominantly male cancer, at advanced stage is only about 50% without reliable molecular indicators for its prognosis. In this study, HPC biopsy samples collected before and after the first-line treatment are classified into different groups according to treatment responses. We analyze the changes of HPC tumor microenvironment (TME) at the single-cell level in response to the treatment and identify three gene modules associated with advanced HPC prognosis. We estimate cell constitutions based on bulk RNA-seq of our HPC samples and build a binary classifier model based on non-malignant cell subtype abundance in TME, which can be used to accurately identify treatment-resistant advanced HPC patients in time and enlarge the possibility to preserve their laryngeal function. In summary, we provide a useful approach to identify gene modules and a classifier model as reliable indicators to predict treatment responses in HPC."
631,Discovering highly potent antimicrobial peptides with deep generative model HydrAMP,"Antimicrobial peptides emerge as compounds that can alleviate the global health hazard of antimicrobial resistance, prompting a need for novel computational approaches to peptide generation. Here, we propose HydrAMP, a conditional variational autoencoder that learns lower-dimensional, continuous representation of peptides and captures their antimicrobial properties. The model disentangles the learnt representation of a peptide from its antimicrobial conditions and leverages parameter-controlled creativity. HydrAMP is the first model that is directly optimized for diverse tasks, including unconstrained and analogue generation and outperforms other approaches in these tasks. An additional preselection procedure based on ranking of generated peptides and molecular dynamics simulations increases experimental validation rate. Wet-lab experiments on five bacterial strains confirm high activity of nine peptides generated as analogues of clinically relevant prototypes, as well as six analogues of an inactive peptide. HydrAMP enables generation of diverse and potent peptides, making a step towards resolving the antimicrobial resistance crisis."
632,Determining protein structures in cellular lamella at pseudo-atomic resolution by GisSPA,"Cryo-electron tomography is a major tool used to study the structure of protein complexes in situ. However, the throughput of tilt-series image data collection is still quite low. Here, we show that GisSPA, a GPU accelerated program, can translationally and rotationally localize the target protein complex in cellular lamellae, as prepared with a focused ion beam, using single cryo-electron microscopy images without tilt-series, and reconstruct the protein complex at near-atomic resolution. GisSPA allows high-throughput data collection without the acquisition of tilt-series images and reconstruction of the tomogram, which is essential for high-resolution reconstruction of asymmetric or low-symmetry protein complexes. We demonstrate the power of GisSPA with 3.4-Å and 3.9-Å resolutions of resolving phycobilisome and tetrameric photosystem II complex structures in cellular lamellae, respectively. In this work, we present GisSPA as a practical tool that facilitates high-resolution in situ protein structure determination."
633,Towards routine chromosome-scale haplotype-resolved reconstruction in cancer genomics,"Cancer genomes are highly complex and heterogeneous. The standard short-read sequencing and analytical methods are unable to provide the complete and precise base-level structural variant landscape of cancer genomes. In this work, we apply high-resolution long accurate HiFi and long-range Hi-C sequencing to the melanoma COLO829 cancer line. Also, we develop an efficient graph-based approach that processes these data types for chromosome-scale haplotype-resolved reconstruction to characterise the cancer precise structural variant landscape. Our method produces high-quality phased scaffolds on the chromosome level on three healthy samples and the COLO829 cancer line in less than half a day even in the absence of trio information, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. In the COLO829 cancer cell line, here we show that our method identifies and characterises precise somatic structural variant calls in important repeat elements that were missed in short-read-based call sets. Our method also finds the precise chromosome-level structural variant (germline and somatic) landscape with 19,956 insertions, 14,846 deletions, 421 duplications, 52 inversions and 498 translocations at the base resolution. Our simple pstools approach should facilitate better personalised diagnosis and disease management, including predicting therapeutic responses."
634,Placental cell type deconvolution reveals that cell proportions drive preeclampsia gene expression differences,"The placenta mediates adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, which is characterized by gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Placental cell type heterogeneity in preeclampsia is not well-understood and limits mechanistic interpretation of bulk gene expression measures. We generated single-cell RNA-sequencing samples for integration with existing data to create the largest deconvolution reference of 19 fetal and 8 maternal cell types from placental villous tissue (
n
 = 9 biological replicates) at term (
n
 = 40,494 cells). We deconvoluted eight published microarray case–control studies of preeclampsia (
n
 = 173 controls, 157 cases). Preeclampsia was associated with excess extravillous trophoblasts and fewer mesenchymal and Hofbauer cells. Adjustment for cellular composition reduced preeclampsia-associated differentially expressed genes (log
2
 fold-change cutoff = 0.1, FDR < 0.05) from 1154 to 0, whereas downregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, aerobic respiration, and ribosome biogenesis were robust to cell type adjustment, suggesting direct changes to these pathways. Cellular composition mediated a substantial proportion of the association between preeclampsia and 
FLT1
 (37.8%, 95% CI [27.5%, 48.8%]), 
LEP
 (34.5%, 95% CI [26.0%, 44.9%]), and 
ENG
 (34.5%, 95% CI [25.0%, 45.3%]) overexpression. Our findings indicate substantial placental cellular heterogeneity in preeclampsia contributes to previously observed bulk gene expression differences. This deconvolution reference lays the groundwork for cellular heterogeneity-aware investigation into placental dysfunction and adverse birth outcomes."
635,Interpretable and context-free deconvolution of multi-scale whole transcriptomic data with UniCell deconvolve,"We introduce UniCell: Deconvolve Base (UCDBase), a pre-trained, interpretable, deep learning model to deconvolve cell type fractions and predict cell identity across Spatial, bulk-RNA-Seq, and scRNA-Seq datasets without contextualized reference data. UCD is trained on 10 million pseudo-mixtures from a fully-integrated scRNA-Seq training database comprising over 28 million annotated single cells spanning 840 unique cell types from 898 studies. We show that our UCDBase and transfer-learning models achieve comparable or superior performance on in-silico mixture deconvolution to existing, reference-based, state-of-the-art methods. Feature attribute analysis uncovers gene signatures associated with cell-type specific inflammatory-fibrotic responses in ischemic kidney injury, discerns cancer subtypes, and accurately deconvolves tumor microenvironments. UCD identifies pathologic changes in cell fractions among bulk-RNA-Seq data for several disease states. Applied to lung cancer scRNA-Seq data, UCD annotates and distinguishes normal from cancerous cells. Overall, UCD enhances transcriptomic data analysis, aiding in assessment of cellular and spatial context."
636,Alternatively spliced exon regulates context-dependent MEF2D higher-order assembly during myogenesis,"During muscle cell differentiation, the alternatively spliced, acidic β-domain potentiates transcription of Myocyte-specific Enhancer Factor 2 (Mef2D). Sequence analysis by the FuzDrop method indicates that the β-domain can serve as an interaction element for Mef2D higher-order assembly. In accord, we observed Mef2D mobile nuclear condensates in C2C12 cells, similar to those formed through liquid-liquid phase separation. In addition, we found Mef2D solid-like aggregates in the cytosol, the presence of which correlated with higher transcriptional activity. In parallel, we observed a progress in the early phase of myotube development, and higher MyoD and desmin expression. In accord with our predictions, the formation of aggregates was promoted by rigid β-domain variants, as well as by a disordered β-domain variant, capable of switching between liquid-like and solid-like higher-order states. Along these lines, NMR and molecular dynamics simulations corroborated that the β-domain can sample both ordered and disordered interactions leading to compact and extended conformations. These results suggest that β-domain fine-tunes Mef2D higher-order assembly to the cellular context, which provides a platform for myogenic regulatory factors and the transcriptional apparatus during the developmental process."
637,Measuring compound eye optics with microscope and microCT images,"With a great variety of shapes and sizes, compound eye morphologies give insight into visual ecology, development, and evolution, and inspire novel engineering. In contrast to our own 
camera-type
 eyes, compound eyes reveal their resolution, sensitivity, and field of view externally, provided they have spherical curvature and orthogonal ommatidia. Non-spherical compound eyes with skewed ommatidia require measuring internal structures, such as with MicroCT (µCT). Thus far, there is no efficient tool to characterize compound eye optics, from either 2D or 3D data, automatically. Here we present two open-source programs: (1) the ommatidia detecting algorithm (ODA), which measures ommatidia count and diameter in 2D images, and (2) a µCT pipeline (ODA-3D), which calculates anatomical acuity, sensitivity, and field of view across the eye by applying the ODA to 3D data. We validate these algorithms on images, images of replicas, and µCT eye scans from ants, fruit flies, moths, and a bee."
638,Protein structure and folding pathway prediction based on remote homologs recognition using PAthreader,"Recognition of remote homologous structures is a necessary module in AlphaFold2 and is also essential for the exploration of protein folding pathways. Here, we propose a method, PAthreader, to recognize remote templates and explore folding pathways. Firstly, we design a three-track alignment between predicted distance profiles and structure profiles extracted from PDB and AlphaFold DB, to improve the recognition accuracy of remote templates. Secondly, we improve the performance of AlphaFold2 using the templates identified by PAthreader. Thirdly, we explore protein folding pathways based on our conjecture that dynamic folding information of protein is implicitly contained in its remote homologs. The results show that the average accuracy of PAthreader templates is 11.6% higher than that of HHsearch. In terms of structure modelling, PAthreader outperform AlphaFold2 and ranks first on the CAMEO blind test for the latest three months. Furthermore, we predict protein folding pathways for 37 proteins, in which the results of 7 proteins are almost consistent with those of biological experiments, and the other 30 human proteins have yet to be verified by biological experiments, revealing that folding information can be exploited from remote homologous structures."
639,Deep-Manager: a versatile tool for optimal feature selection in live-cell imaging analysis,"One of the major problems in bioimaging, often highly underestimated, is whether features extracted for a discrimination or regression task will remain valid for a broader set of similar experiments or in the presence of unpredictable perturbations during the image acquisition process. Such an issue is even more important when it is addressed in the context of deep learning features due to the lack of a priori known relationship between the black-box descriptors (deep features) and the phenotypic properties of the biological entities under study. In this regard, the widespread use of descriptors, such as those coming from pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is hindered by the fact that they are devoid of apparent physical meaning and strongly subjected to unspecific biases, i.e., features that do not depend on the cell phenotypes, but rather on acquisition artifacts, such as brightness or texture changes, focus shifts, autofluorescence or photobleaching. The proposed Deep-Manager software platform offers the possibility to efficiently select those features having lower sensitivity to unspecific disturbances and, at the same time, a high discriminating power. Deep-Manager can be used in the context of both handcrafted and deep features. The unprecedented performances of the method are proven using five different case studies, ranging from selecting handcrafted green fluorescence protein intensity features in chemotherapy-related breast cancer cell death investigation to addressing problems related to the context of Deep Transfer Learning.

640,Effect of Fc core fucosylation and light chain isotype on IgG1 flexibility,"N-glycosylation plays a key role in modulating the bioactivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as well as the light chain (LC) isotype can influence their physicochemical properties. However, investigating the impact of such features on mAbs conformational behavior is a big challenge, due to the very high flexibility of these biomolecules. In this work we investigate, by accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), the conformational behavior of two commercial immunoglobulins G1 (IgG1), representative of κ and λ LCs antibodies, in both their fucosylated and afucosylated forms. Our results show, through the identification of a stable conformation, how the combination of fucosylation and LC isotype modulates the hinge behavior, the Fc conformation and the position of the glycan chains, all factors potentially affecting the binding to the FcγRs. This work also represents a technological enhancement in the conformational exploration of mAbs, making aMD a suitable approach to clarify experimental results."
641,"An autoimmune pleiotropic SNP modulates 
IRF5
 alternative promoter usage through ZBTB3-mediated chromatin looping","Genetic sharing is extensively observed for autoimmune diseases, but the causal variants and their underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Through systematic investigation of autoimmune disease pleiotropic loci, we found most of these shared genetic effects are transmitted from regulatory code. We used an evidence-based strategy to functionally prioritize causal pleiotropic variants and identify their target genes. A top-ranked pleiotropic variant, rs4728142, yielded many lines of evidence as being causal. Mechanistically, the rs4728142-containing region interacts with the 
IRF5
 alternative promoter in an allele-specific manner and orchestrates its upstream enhancer to regulate 
IRF5
 alternative promoter usage through chromatin looping. A putative structural regulator, ZBTB3, mediates the allele-specific loop to promote 
IRF5
-short transcript expression at the rs4728142 risk allele, resulting in 
IRF5
 overactivation and M1 macrophage polarization. Together, our findings establish a causal mechanism between the regulatory variant and fine-scale molecular phenotype underlying the dysfunction of pleiotropic genes in human autoimmunity."
642,RNA splicing analysis using heterogeneous and large RNA-seq datasets,"The ubiquity of RNA-seq has led to many methods that use RNA-seq data to analyze variations in RNA splicing. However, available methods are not well suited for handling heterogeneous and large datasets. Such datasets scale to thousands of samples across dozens of experimental conditions, exhibit increased variability compared to biological replicates, and involve thousands of unannotated splice variants resulting in increased transcriptome complexity. We describe here a suite of algorithms and tools implemented in the MAJIQ v2 package to address challenges in detection, quantification, and visualization of splicing variations from such datasets. Using both large scale synthetic data and GTEx v8 as benchmark datasets, we assess the advantages of MAJIQ v2 compared to existing methods. We then apply MAJIQ v2 package to analyze differential splicing across 2,335 samples from 13 brain subregions, demonstrating its ability to offer insights into brain subregion-specific splicing regulation."
643,"A modular architecture for organizing, processing and sharing neurophysiology data","We describe an architecture for organizing, integrating and sharing neurophysiology data within a single laboratory or across a group of collaborators. It comprises a database linking data files to metadata and electronic laboratory notes; a module collecting data from multiple laboratories into one location; a protocol for searching and sharing data and a module for automatic analyses that populates a website. These modules can be used together or individually, by single laboratories or worldwide collaborations."
644,Efficient end-to-end learning for cell segmentation with machine generated weak annotations,"Automated cell segmentation from optical microscopy images is usually the first step in the pipeline of single-cell analysis. Recently, deep-learning based algorithms have shown superior performances for the cell segmentation tasks. However, a disadvantage of deep-learning is the requirement for a large amount of fully annotated training data, which is costly to generate. Weakly-supervised and self-supervised learning is an active research area, but often the model accuracy is inversely correlated with the amount of annotation information provided. Here we focus on a specific subtype of weak annotations, which can be generated programmably from experimental data, thus allowing for more annotation information content without sacrificing the annotation speed. We designed a new model architecture for end-to-end training using such incomplete annotations. We have benchmarked our method on a variety of publicly available datasets, covering both fluorescence and bright-field imaging modality. We additionally tested our method on a microscopy dataset generated by us, using machine-generated annotations. The results demonstrated that our models trained under weak supervision can achieve segmentation accuracy competitive to, and in some cases, surpassing, state-of-the-art models trained under full supervision. Therefore, our method can be a practical alternative to the established full-supervision methods."
645,In silico tissue generation and power analysis for spatial omics,"As spatially resolved multiplex profiling of RNA and proteins becomes more prominent, it is increasingly important to understand the statistical power available to test specific hypotheses when designing and interpreting such experiments. Ideally, it would be possible to create an oracle that predicts sampling requirements for generalized spatial experiments. However, the unknown number of relevant spatial features and the complexity of spatial data analysis make this challenging. Here, we enumerate multiple parameters of interest that should be considered in the design of a properly powered spatial omics study. We introduce a method for tunable in silico tissue (IST) generation and use it with spatial profiling data sets to construct an exploratory computational framework for spatial power analysis. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework can be applied across diverse spatial data modalities and tissues of interest. While we demonstrate ISTs in the context of spatial power analysis, these simulated tissues have other potential use cases, including spatial method benchmarking and optimization."
646,"Spatially informed clustering, integration, and deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics with GraphST","Spatial transcriptomics technologies generate gene expression profiles with spatial context, requiring spatially informed analysis tools for three key tasks, spatial clustering, multisample integration, and cell-type deconvolution. We present GraphST, a graph self-supervised contrastive learning method that fully exploits spatial transcriptomics data to outperform existing methods. It combines graph neural networks with self-supervised contrastive learning to learn informative and discriminative spot representations by minimizing the embedding distance between spatially adjacent spots and vice versa. We demonstrated GraphST on multiple tissue types and technology platforms. GraphST achieved 10% higher clustering accuracy and better delineated fine-grained tissue structures in brain and embryo tissues. GraphST is also the only method that can jointly analyze multiple tissue slices in vertical or horizontal integration while correcting batch effects. Lastly, GraphST demonstrated superior cell-type deconvolution to capture spatial niches like lymph node germinal centers and exhausted tumor infiltrating T cells in breast tumor tissue."
647,Predicting locations of cryptic pockets from single protein structures using the PocketMiner graph neural network,"Cryptic pockets expand the scope of drug discovery by enabling targeting of proteins currently considered undruggable because they lack pockets in their ground state structures. However, identifying cryptic pockets is labor-intensive and slow. The ability to accurately and rapidly predict if and where cryptic pockets are likely to form from a structure would greatly accelerate the search for druggable pockets. Here, we present PocketMiner, a graph neural network trained to predict where pockets are likely to open in molecular dynamics simulations. Applying PocketMiner to single structures from a newly curated dataset of 39 experimentally confirmed cryptic pockets demonstrates that it accurately identifies cryptic pockets (ROC-AUC: 0.87) >1,000-fold faster than existing methods. We apply PocketMiner across the human proteome and show that predicted pockets open in simulations, suggesting that over half of proteins thought to lack pockets based on available structures likely contain cryptic pockets, vastly expanding the potentially druggable proteome."
648,Automatic and accurate ligand structure determination guided by cryo-electron microscopy maps,"Advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and deep-learning guided protein structure prediction have expedited structural studies of protein complexes. However, methods for accurately determining ligand conformations are lacking. In this manuscript, we develop EMERALD, a tool for automatically determining ligand structures guided by medium-resolution cryoEM density. We show this method is robust at predicting ligands along with surrounding side chains in maps as low as 4.5 Å local resolution. Combining this with a measure of placement confidence and running on all protein/ligand structures in the EMDB, we show that 57% of ligands replicate the deposited model, 16% confidently find alternate conformations, 22% have ambiguous density where multiple conformations might be present, and 5% are incorrectly placed. For five cases where our approach finds an alternate conformation with high confidence, high-resolution crystal structures validate our placement. EMERALD and the resulting analysis should prove critical in using cryoEM to solve protein-ligand complexes."
649,Structural details of a Class B GPCR-arrestin complex revealed by genetically encoded crosslinkers in living cells,"Understanding the molecular basis of arrestin-mediated regulation of GPCRs is critical for deciphering signaling mechanisms and designing functional selectivity. However, structural studies of GPCR-arrestin complexes are hampered by their highly dynamic nature. Here, we dissect the interaction of arrestin-2 (arr2) with the secretin-like parathyroid hormone 1 receptor PTH1R using genetically encoded crosslinking amino acids in live cells. We identify 136 intermolecular proximity points that guide the construction of energy-optimized molecular models for the PTH1R-arr2 complex. Our data reveal flexible receptor elements missing in existing structures, including intracellular loop 3 and the proximal C-tail, and suggest a functional role of a hitherto overlooked positively charged region at the arrestin N-edge. Unbiased MD simulations highlight the stability and dynamic nature of the complex. Our integrative approach yields structural insights into protein-protein complexes in a biologically relevant live-cell environment and provides information inaccessible to classical structural methods, while also revealing the dynamics of the system."
650,Reciprocal causation mixture model for robust Mendelian randomization analysis using genome-scale summary data,"Mendelian randomization using GWAS summary statistics has become a popular method to infer causal relationships across complex diseases. However, the widespread pleiotropy observed in GWAS has made the selection of valid instrumental variables problematic, leading to possible violations of Mendelian randomization assumptions and thus potentially invalid inferences concerning causation. Furthermore, current MR methods can examine causation in only one direction, so that two separate analyses are required for bi-directional analysis. In this study, we propose a ststistical framework, MRCI (Mixture model Reciprocal Causation Inference), to estimate reciprocal causation between two phenotypes simultaneously using the genome-scale summary statistics of the two phenotypes and reference linkage disequilibrium information. Simulation studies, including strong correlated pleiotropy, showed that MRCI obtained nearly unbiased estimates of causation in both directions, and correct Type I error rates under the null hypothesis. In applications to real GWAS data, MRCI detected significant bi-directional and uni-directional causal influences between common diseases and putative risk factors."
651,"Evaluating elimination thresholds and stopping criteria for interventions against the vector-borne macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, using mathematical modelling","We leveraged the ability of EPIFIL transmission models fit to field data to evaluate the use of the WHO Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) for supporting Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) intervention stopping decisions. Our results indicate that understanding the underlying parasite extinction dynamics, particularly the protracted transient dynamics involved in shifts to the extinct state, is crucial for understanding the impacts of using TAS for determining the achievement of LF elimination. These findings warn that employing stopping criteria set for operational purposes, as employed in the TAS strategy, without a full consideration of the dynamics of extinction could seriously undermine the goal of achieving global LF elimination."
652,Cross-platform normalization enables machine learning model training on microarray and RNA-seq data simultaneously,"Large compendia of gene expression data have proven valuable for the discovery of novel biological relationships. Historically, most available RNA assays were run on microarray, while RNA-seq is now the platform of choice for many new experiments. The data structure and distributions between the platforms differ, making it challenging to combine them directly. Here we perform supervised and unsupervised machine learning evaluations to assess which existing normalization methods are best suited for combining microarray and RNA-seq data. We find that quantile and Training Distribution Matching normalization allow for supervised and unsupervised model training on microarray and RNA-seq data simultaneously. Nonparanormal normalization and z-scores are also appropriate for some applications, including pathway analysis with Pathway-Level Information Extractor (PLIER). We demonstrate that it is possible to perform effective cross-platform normalization using existing methods to combine microarray and RNA-seq data for machine learning applications."
653,Hierarchical graph learning for protein–protein interaction,"Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are fundamental means of functions and signalings in biological systems. The massive growth in demand and cost associated with experimental PPI studies calls for computational tools for automated prediction and understanding of PPIs. Despite recent progress, in silico methods remain inadequate in modeling the natural PPI hierarchy. Here we present a double-viewed hierarchical graph learning model, HIGH-PPI, to predict PPIs and extrapolate the molecular details involved. In this model, we create a hierarchical graph, in which a node in the PPI network (top outside-of-protein view) is a protein graph (bottom inside-of-protein view). In the bottom view, a group of chemically relevant descriptors, instead of the protein sequences, are used to better capture the structure-function relationship of the protein. HIGH-PPI examines both outside-of-protein and inside-of-protein of the human interactome to establish a robust machine understanding of PPIs. This model demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in predicting PPIs. Moreover, HIGH-PPI can interpret the modes of action of PPIs by identifying important binding and catalytic sites precisely. Overall, “HIGH-PPI [
https://github.com/zqgao22/HIGH-PPI
]” is a domain-knowledge-driven and interpretable framework for PPI prediction studies."
654,A variational algorithm to detect the clonal copy number substructure of tumors from scRNA-seq data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing is the reference technology to characterize the composition of the tumor microenvironment and to study tumor heterogeneity at high resolution. Here we report Single CEll Variational ANeuploidy analysis (SCEVAN), a fast variational algorithm for the deconvolution of the clonal substructure of tumors from single-cell RNA-seq data. It uses a multichannel segmentation algorithm exploiting the assumption that all the cells in a given copy number clone share the same breakpoints. Thus, the smoothed expression profile of every individual cell constitutes part of the evidence of the copy number profile in each subclone. SCEVAN can automatically and accurately discriminate between malignant and non-malignant cells, resulting in a practical framework to analyze tumors and their microenvironment. We apply SCEVAN to datasets encompassing 106 samples and 93,322 cells from different tumor types and technologies. We demonstrate its application to characterize the intratumor heterogeneity and geographic evolution of malignant brain tumors."
655,Evaluating native-like structures of RNA-protein complexes through the deep learning method,"RNA-protein complexes underlie numerous cellular processes, including basic translation and gene regulation. The high-resolution structure determination of the RNA-protein complexes is essential for elucidating their functions. Therefore, computational methods capable of identifying the native-like RNA-protein structures are needed. To address this challenge, we thus develop DRPScore, a deep-learning-based approach for identifying native-like RNA-protein structures. DRPScore is tested on representative sets of RNA-protein complexes with various degrees of binding-induced conformation change ranging from fully rigid docking (bound-bound) to fully flexible docking (unbound-unbound). Out of the top 20 predictions, DRPScore selects native-like structures with a success rate of 91.67% on the testing set of bound RNA-protein complexes and 56.14% on the unbound complexes. DRPScore consistently outperforms existing methods with a roughly 10.53–15.79% improvement, even for the most difficult unbound cases. Furthermore, DRPScore significantly improves the accuracy of the native interface interaction predictions. DRPScore should be broadly useful for modeling and designing RNA-protein complexes."
656,A thousand-genome panel retraces the global spread and adaptation of a major fungal crop pathogen,"Human activity impacts the evolutionary trajectories of many species worldwide. Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of pathogens reshaping their genetic makeup and providing opportunities for virulence gains. Understanding how pathogens surmount control strategies and cope with new climates is crucial to predicting the future impact of crop pathogens. Here, we address this by assembling a global thousand-genome panel of 
Zymoseptoria tritici
, a major fungal pathogen of wheat reported in all production areas worldwide. We identify the global invasion routes and ongoing genetic exchange of the pathogen among wheat-growing regions. We find that the global expansion was accompanied by increased activity of transposable elements and weakened genomic defenses. Finally, we find significant standing variation for adaptation to new climates encountered during the global spread. Our work shows how large population genomic panels enable deep insights into the evolutionary trajectory of a major crop pathogen."
657,"Outbreak.info Research Library: a standardized, searchable platform to discover and explore COVID-19 resources","Outbreak.info Research Library is a standardized, searchable interface of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) publications, clinical trials, datasets, protocols and other resources, built with a reusable framework. We developed a rigorous schema to enforce consistency across different sources and resource types and linked related resources. Researchers can quickly search the latest research across data repositories, regardless of resource type or repository location, via a search interface, public application programming interface (API) and R package."
658,Outbreak.info genomic reports: scalable and dynamic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutations,"In response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, the global scientific community, through unprecedented effort, has sequenced and shared over 11 million genomes through GISAID, as of May 2022. This extraordinarily high sampling rate provides a unique opportunity to track the evolution of the virus in near real-time. Here, we present 
outbreak.info
, a platform that currently tracks over 40 million combinations of Pango lineages and individual mutations, across over 7,000 locations, to provide insights for researchers, public health officials and the general public. We describe the interpretable visualizations available in our web application, the pipelines that enable the scalable ingestion of heterogeneous sources of SARS-CoV-2 variant data and the server infrastructure that enables widespread data dissemination via a high-performance API that can be accessed using an R package. We show how 
outbreak.info
 can be used for genomic surveillance and as a hypothesis-generation tool to understand the ongoing pandemic at varying geographic and temporal scales."
659,MacroH2A histone variants modulate enhancer activity to repress oncogenic programs and cellular reprogramming,"Considerable efforts have been made to characterize active enhancer elements, which can be annotated by accessible chromatin and H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). However, apart from poised enhancers that are observed in early stages of development and putative silencers, the functional significance of 
cis
-regulatory elements lacking H3K27ac is poorly understood. Here we show that macroH2A histone variants mark a subset of enhancers in normal and cancer cells, which we coined ‘macro-Bound Enhancers’, that modulate enhancer activity. We find macroH2A variants localized at enhancer elements that are devoid of H3K27ac in a cell type-specific manner, indicating a role for macroH2A at inactive enhancers to maintain cell identity. In following, reactivation of macro-bound enhancers is associated with oncogenic programs in breast cancer and their repressive role is correlated with the activity of macroH2A2 as a negative regulator of BRD4 chromatin occupancy. Finally, through single cell epigenomic profiling of normal mammary stem cells derived from mice, we show that macroH2A deficiency facilitates increased activity of transcription factors associated with stem cell activity."
660,Reconstructing clonal tree for phylo-phenotypic characterization of cancer using single-cell transcriptomics,"Functional characterization of the cancer clones can shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms driving cancer’s proliferation and relapse mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing data provide grounds for understanding the functional state of cancer as a whole; however, much research remains to identify and reconstruct clonal relationships toward characterizing the changes in functions of individual clones. We present PhylEx that integrates bulk genomics data with co-occurrences of mutations from single-cell RNA sequencing data to reconstruct high-fidelity clonal trees. We evaluate PhylEx on synthetic and well-characterized high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell line datasets. PhylEx outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both when comparing capacity for clonal tree reconstruction and for identifying clones. We analyze high-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer data to show that PhylEx exploits clonal expression profiles beyond what is possible with expression-based clustering methods and clear the way for accurate inference of clonal trees and robust phylo-phenotypic analysis of cancer."
661,Epidemiological impacts of the NHS COVID-19 app in England and Wales throughout its first year,"The NHS COVID-19 app was launched in England and Wales in September 2020, with a Bluetooth-based contact tracing functionality designed to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We show that user engagement and the app’s epidemiological impacts varied according to changing social and epidemic characteristics throughout the app’s first year. We describe the interaction and complementarity of manual and digital contact tracing approaches. Results of our statistical analyses of anonymised, aggregated app data include that app users who were recently notified were more likely to test positive than app users who were not recently notified, by a factor that varied considerably over time. We estimate that the app’s contact tracing function alone averted about 1 million cases (sensitivity analysis 450,000–1,400,000) during its first year, corresponding to 44,000 hospital cases (SA 20,000–60,000) and 9,600 deaths (SA 4600–13,000)."
662,ASGARD is A Single-cell Guided Pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs,"Single-cell RNA sequencing technology has enabled in-depth analysis of intercellular heterogeneity in various diseases. However, its full potential for precision medicine has yet to be reached. Towards this, we propose A Single-cell Guided Pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs (ASGARD) that defines a drug score to recommend drugs by considering all cell clusters to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy on single-drug therapy compared to two bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods. We also demonstrated that it performs considerably better than other cell cluster-level predicting methods. In addition, we validate ASGARD using the drug response prediction method TRANSACT with Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer patient samples. We find that many top-ranked drugs are either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In conclusion, ASGARD is a promising drug repurposing recommendation tool guided by single-cell RNA-seq for personalized medicine. ASGARD is free for educational use at

663,Single-cell biological network inference using a heterogeneous graph transformer,"Single-cell multi-omics (scMulti-omics) allows the quantification of multiple modalities simultaneously to capture the intricacy of complex molecular mechanisms and cellular heterogeneity. Existing tools cannot effectively infer the active biological networks in diverse cell types and the response of these networks to external stimuli. Here we present DeepMAPS for biological network inference from scMulti-omics. It models scMulti-omics in a heterogeneous graph and learns relations among cells and genes within both local and global contexts in a robust manner using a multi-head graph transformer. Benchmarking results indicate DeepMAPS performs better than existing tools in cell clustering and biological network construction. It also showcases competitive capability in deriving cell-type-specific biological networks in lung tumor leukocyte CITE-seq data and matched diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. In addition, we deploy a DeepMAPS webserver equipped with multiple functionalities and visualizations to improve the usability and reproducibility of scMulti-omics data analysis."
664,Batch alignment of single-cell transcriptomics data using deep metric learning,"scRNA-seq has uncovered previously unappreciated levels of heterogeneity. With the increasing scale of scRNA-seq studies, the major challenge is correcting batch effect and accurately detecting the number of cell types, which is inevitable in human studies. The majority of scRNA-seq algorithms have been specifically designed to remove batch effect firstly and then conduct clustering, which may miss some rare cell types. Here we develop scDML, a 
d
eep 
m
etric 
l
earning model to remove batch effect in 
sc
RNA-seq data, guided by the initial clusters and the nearest neighbor information intra and inter batches. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues demonstrated that scDML can remove batch effect, improve clustering performance, accurately recover true cell types and consistently outperform popular methods such as Seurat 3, scVI, Scanorama, BBKNN, Harmony et al. Most importantly, scDML preserves subtle cell types in raw data and enables discovery of new cell subtypes that are hard to extract by analyzing each batch individually. We also show that scDML is scalable to large datasets with lower peak memory usage, and we believe that scDML offers a valuable tool to study complex cellular heterogeneity."
665,Endogenous DAF-16 spatiotemporal activity quantitatively predicts lifespan extension induced by dietary restriction,"In many organisms, dietary restriction (DR) leads to lifespan extension through the activation of cell protection and pro-longevity gene expression programs. In the nematode 
C. elegans
, the DAF-16 transcription factor is a key aging regulator that governs the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of cells when animals are exposed to food limitation. However, how large is the influence of DR on DAF-16 activity, and its subsequent impact on lifespan has not been quantitatively determined. In this work, we assess the endogenous activity of DAF-16 under various DR regimes by coupling CRISPR/Cas9-enabled fluorescent tagging of DAF-16 with quantitative image analysis and machine learning. Our results indicate that DR regimes induce strong endogenous DAF-16 activity, although DAF-16 is less responsive in aged individuals. DAF-16 activity is in turn a robust predictor of mean lifespan in 
C. elegans
, accounting for 78% of its variability under DR. Analysis of tissue-specific expression aided by a machine learning tissue classifier reveals that, under DR, the largest contribution to DAF-16 nuclear intensity originates from the intestine and neurons. DR also drives DAF-16 activity in unexpected locations such as the germline and intestinal nucleoli."
666,FLI1 and FRA1 transcription factors drive the transcriptional regulatory networks characterizing muscle invasive bladder cancer,"Bladder cancer is mostly present in the form of urothelium carcinoma, causing over 150,000 deaths each year. Its histopathological classification as muscle invasive (MIBC) and non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) is the most prominent aspect, affecting the prognosis and progression of this disease. In this study, we defined the active regulatory landscape of MIBC and NMIBC cell lines using H3K27ac ChIP-seq and used an integrative approach to combine our findings with existing data. Our analysis revealed FRA1 and FLI1 as two critical transcription factors differentially regulating MIBC regulatory landscape. We show that FRA1 and FLI1 regulate the genes involved in epithelial cell migration and cell junction organization. Knock-down of FRA1 and FLI1 in MIBC revealed the downregulation of several EMT-related genes such as 
MAP4K4
 and 
FLOT1
. Further, ChIP-SICAP performed for FRA1 and FLI1 enabled us to infer chromatin binding partners of these transcription factors and link this information with their target genes. Finally, we show that knock-down of FRA1 and FLI1 result in significant reduction of invasion capacity of MIBC cells towards muscle microenvironment using IC-CHIP assays. Our results collectively highlight the role of these transcription factors in selection and design of targeted options for treatment of MIBC."
667,Pan-cancer clinical impact of latent drivers from double mutations,"Here, we discover potential ‘latent driver’ mutations in cancer genomes. Latent drivers have low frequencies and minor observable translational potential. As such, to date they have escaped identification. Their discovery is important, since when paired in 
cis
, latent driver mutations can drive cancer. Our comprehensive statistical analysis of the pan-cancer mutation profiles of ~60,000 tumor sequences from the TCGA and AACR-GENIE cohorts identifies significantly co-occurring potential latent drivers. We observe 155 same gene double mutations of which 140 individual components are cataloged as latent drivers. Evaluation of cell lines and patient-derived xenograft response data to drug treatment indicate that in certain genes double mutations may have a prominent role in increasing oncogenic activity, hence obtaining a better drug response, as in 
PIK3CA
. Taken together, our comprehensive analyses indicate that same-gene double mutations are exceedingly rare phenomena but are a signature for some cancer types, e.g., breast, and lung cancers. The relative rarity of doublets can be explained by the likelihood of strong signals resulting in oncogene-induced senescence, and by doublets consisting of non-identical single residue components populating the background mutational load, thus not identified."
668,Reconstruction of the tumor spatial microenvironment along the malignant-boundary-nonmalignant axis,"Although advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) enlarge to unveil spatial landscape of tissues, it remains challenging to delineate pathology-relevant and cellular localizations, and interactions exclusive to a spatial niche (e.g., tumor boundary). Here, we develop Cottrazm, integrating ST with hematoxylin and eosin histological image, and single-cell transcriptomics to delineate the tumor boundary connecting malignant and non-malignant cell spots in tumor tissues, deconvolute cell-type composition at spatial location, and reconstruct cell type-specific gene expression profiles at sub-spot level. We validate the performance of Cottrazm along the malignant-boundary-nonmalignant spatial axis. We identify specific macrophage and fibroblast subtypes localized around tumor boundary that interacted with tumor cells to generate a structural boundary, which limits T cell infiltration and promotes immune exclusion in tumor microenvironment. In this work, Cottrazm provides an integrated tool framework to dissect the tumor spatial microenvironment and facilitates the discovery of functional biological insights, thereby identifying therapeutic targets in oncologic ST datasets."
669,Unraveling topoisomerase IA gate dynamics in presence of PPEF and its preclinical evaluation against multidrug-resistant pathogens,"Type IA topoisomerases maintain DNA topology by cleaving ssDNA and relaxing negative supercoils. The inhibition of its activity in bacteria prevents the relaxation of negative supercoils, which in turn impedes DNA metabolic processes leading to cell death. Using this hypothesis, two bisbenzimidazoles, PPEF and BPVF are synthesized, selectively inhibiting bacterial TopoIA and TopoIII. PPEF stabilizes the topoisomerase and topoisomerase-ssDNA complex, acts as an interfacial inhibitor. PPEF display high efficacy against ~455 multi-drug resistant gram positive and negative bacteria. To understand molecular mechanism of inhibition of TopoIA and PPEF, accelerated MD simulation is carried out, and results suggested that PPEF binds, stabilizes the closed conformation of TopoIA with –6Kcal/mol binding energy and destabilizes the binding of ssDNA. The TopoIA gate dynamics model can be used as a tool to screen TopoIA inhibitors as therapeutic candidates. PPEF and BPVF cause cellular filamentation and DNA fragmentation leading to bacterial cell death. PPEF and BPVF show potent efficacy against systemic and neutropenic mouse models harboring 
E. coli
, VRSA, and MRSA infection without cellular toxicity."
670,Copy number variation-associated lncRNAs may contribute to the etiologies of congenital heart disease,"Copy number variations (CNVs) have long been recognized as pathogenic factors for congenital heart disease (CHD). Few CHD associated CNVs could be interpreted as dosage effect due to disruption of coding sequences. Emerging evidences have highlighted the regulatory roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cardiac development. Whereas it remains unexplored whether lncRNAs within CNVs (CNV-lncRNAs) could contribute to the etiology of CHD associated CNVs. Here we constructed coexpression networks involving CNV-lncRNAs within CHD associated CNVs and protein coding genes using the human organ developmental transcriptomic data, and showed that CNV-lncRNAs within 10 of the non-syndromic CHD associated CNVs clustered in the most significant heart correlated module, and had highly correlated coexpression with multiple key CHD genes. 
HSALNG0104472
 within 15q11.2 region was identified as a hub CNV-lncRNA with heart-biased expression and validated experimentally. Our results indicated that 
HSALNG0104472
 should be a main effector responsible for cardiac defects of 15q11.2 deletion through regulating cardiomyocytes differentiation. Our findings suggested that CNV-lncRNAs could potentially contribute to the pathologies of a maximum proportion of 68.4% (13/19) of non-syndromic CHD associated CNVs. These results indicated that explaining the pathogenesis of CHD associated CNVs should take account of the noncoding regions."
671,Hypothesis-free phenotype prediction within a genetics-first framework,"Cohort-wide sequencing studies have revealed that the largest category of variants is those deemed ‘rare’, even for the subset located in coding regions (99% of known coding variants are seen in less than 1% of the population. Associative methods give some understanding how rare genetic variants influence disease and organism-level phenotypes. But here we show that additional discoveries can be made through a knowledge-based approach using protein domains and ontologies (function and phenotype) that considers all coding variants regardless of allele frequency. We describe an ab initio, genetics-first method making molecular knowledge-based interpretations for exome-wide non-synonymous variants for phenotypes at the organism and cellular level. By using this reverse approach, we identify plausible genetic causes for developmental disorders that have eluded other established methods and present molecular hypotheses for the causal genetics of 40 phenotypes generated from a direct-to-consumer genotype cohort. This system offers a chance to extract further discovery from genetic data after standard tools have been applied."
672,Widespread perturbation of ETS factor binding sites in cancer,"Although >90% of somatic mutations reside in non-coding regions, few have been reported as cancer drivers. To predict driver non-coding variants (NCVs), we present a transcription factor (TF)-aware burden test based on a model of coherent TF function in promoters. We apply this test to NCVs from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes cohort and predict 2555 driver NCVs in the promoters of 813 genes across 20 cancer types. These genes are enriched in cancer-related gene ontologies, essential genes, and genes associated with cancer prognosis. We find that 765 candidate driver NCVs alter transcriptional activity, 510 lead to differential binding of TF-cofactor regulatory complexes, and that they primarily impact the binding of ETS factors. Finally, we show that different NCVs within a promoter often affect transcriptional activity through shared mechanisms. Our integrated computational and experimental approach shows that cancer NCVs are widespread and that ETS factors are commonly disrupted."
673,SODB facilitates comprehensive exploration of spatial omics data,"Spatial omics technologies generate wealthy but highly complex datasets. Here we present Spatial Omics DataBase (SODB), a web-based platform providing both rich data resources and a suite of interactive data analytical modules. SODB currently maintains >2,400 experiments from >25 spatial omics technologies, which are freely accessible as a unified data format compatible with various computational packages. SODB also provides multiple interactive data analytical modules, especially a unique module, Spatial Omics View (SOView). We conduct comprehensive statistical analyses and illustrate the utility of both basic and advanced analytical modules using multiple spatial omics datasets. We demonstrate SOView utility with brain spatial transcriptomics data and recover known anatomical structures. We further delineate functional tissue domains with associated marker genes that were obscured when analyzed using previous methods. We finally show how SODB may efficiently facilitate computational method development. The SODB website is

674,Translating transcriptomic findings from cancer model systems to humans through joint dimension reduction,"Model systems are an essential resource in cancer research. They simulate effects that we can infer into humans, but come at a risk of inaccurately representing human biology. This inaccuracy can lead to inconclusive experiments or misleading results, urging the need for an improved process for translating model system findings into human-relevant data. We present a process for applying joint dimension reduction (jDR) to horizontally integrate gene expression data across model systems and human tumor cohorts. We then use this approach to combine human TCGA gene expression data with data from human cancer cell lines and mouse model tumors. By identifying the aspects of genomic variation joint-acting across cohorts, we demonstrate how predictive modeling and clinical biomarkers from model systems can be improved."
675,Network of hotspot interactions cluster tau amyloid folds,"Cryogenic electron microscopy has revealed unprecedented molecular insight into the conformations of β-sheet-rich protein amyloids linked to neurodegenerative diseases. It remains unknown how a protein can adopt a diversity of folds and form multiple distinct fibrillar structures. Here we develop an in silico alanine scan method to estimate the relative energetic contribution of each amino acid in an amyloid assembly. We apply our method to twenty-seven ex vivo and in vitro fibril structural polymorphs of the microtubule-associated protein tau. We uncover networks of energetically important interactions involving amyloid-forming motifs that stabilize the different fibril folds. We evaluate our predictions in cellular and in vitro aggregation assays. Using a machine learning approach, we classify the structures based on residue energetics to identify distinguishing and unifying features. Our energetic profiling suggests that minimal sequence elements control the stability of tau fibrils, allowing future design of protein sequences that fold into unique structures."
676,Optimal age targeting for pneumococcal vaccination in older adults; a modelling study,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) risk increases with age for older adults whereas the population size benefiting from pneumococcal vaccines and robustness of immunogenic response to vaccination decline. We estimate how demographics, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE), and waning VE impact on optimal age for a single-dose pneumococcal vaccination. Age- and vaccine-serotype-specific IPD cases from routine surveillance of adults ≥ 55 years old (y), ≥ 4-years after infant-pneumococcal vaccine introduction and before 2020, and VE data from prior studies were used to estimate IPD incidence and waning VE which were then combined in a cohort model of vaccine impact. In Brazil, Malawi, South Africa and England 51, 51, 54 and 39% of adults older than 55 y were younger than 65 years old, with a smaller share of annual IPD cases reported among < 65 years old in England (4,657; 20%) than Brazil (186; 45%), Malawi (4; 63%), or South Africa (134, 48%). Vaccination at 55 years in Brazil, Malawi, and South Africa, and at 70 years in England had the greatest potential for IPD prevention. Here, we show that in low/middle-income countries, pneumococcal vaccines may prevent a substantial proportion of residual IPD burden if administered earlier in adulthood than is typical in high-income countries."
677,A molecular atlas reveals the tri-sectional spinning mechanism of spider dragline silk,"The process of natural silk production in the spider major ampullate (Ma) gland endows dragline silk with extraordinary mechanical properties and the potential for biomimetic applications. However, the precise genetic roles of the Ma gland during this process remain unknown. Here, we performed a systematic molecular atlas of dragline silk production through a high-quality genome assembly for the golden orb-weaving spider 
Trichonephila clavata
 and a multiomics approach to defining the Ma gland tri-sectional architecture: Tail, Sac, and Duct. We uncovered a hierarchical biosynthesis of spidroins, organic acids, lipids, and chitin in the sectionalized Ma gland dedicated to fine silk constitution. The ordered secretion of spidroins was achieved by the synergetic regulation of epigenetic and ceRNA signatures for genomic group-distributed spidroin genes. Single-cellular and spatial RNA profiling identified ten cell types with partitioned functional division determining the tri-sectional organization of the Ma gland. Convergence analysis and genetic manipulation further validated that this tri-sectional architecture of the silk gland was analogous across Arthropoda and inextricably linked with silk formation. Collectively, our study provides multidimensional data that significantly expand the knowledge of spider dragline silk generation and ultimately benefit innovation in spider-inspired fibers."
678,Effects of presenilin-1 familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations on γ-secretase activation for cleavage of amyloid precursor protein,"Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase which cleaves within the transmembrane domain of over 150 peptide substrates. Dominant missense mutations in PS1 cause early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD); however, the exact pathogenic mechanism remains unknown. Here we combined Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations and biochemical experiments to determine the effects of six representative PS1 FAD mutations (P117L, I143T, L166P, G384A, L435F, and L286V) on the enzyme-substrate interactions between γ-secretase and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Biochemical experiments showed that all six PS1 FAD mutations rendered γ-secretase less active for the endoproteolytic (ε) cleavage of APP. Distinct low-energy conformational states were identified from the free energy profiles of wildtype and PS1 FAD-mutant γ-secretase. The P117L and L286V FAD mutants could still sample the “Active” state for substrate cleavage, but with noticeably reduced conformational space compared with the wildtype. The other mutants hardly visited the “Active” state. The PS1 FAD mutants were found to reduce γ-secretase proteolytic activity by hindering APP residue L49 from proper orientation in the active site and/or disrupting the distance between the catalytic aspartates. Therefore, our findings provide mechanistic insights into how PS1 FAD mutations affect structural dynamics and enzyme-substrate interactions of γ-secretase and APP."
679,Quantifying portable genetic effects and improving cross-ancestry genetic prediction with GWAS summary statistics,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Europeans are known to have substantially reduced predictive accuracy in non-European populations, limiting their clinical utility and raising concerns about health disparities across ancestral populations. Here, we introduce a statistical framework named X-Wing to improve predictive performance in ancestrally diverse populations. X-Wing quantifies local genetic correlations for complex traits between populations, employs an annotation-dependent estimation procedure to amplify correlated genetic effects between populations, and combines multiple population-specific PRS into a unified score with GWAS summary statistics alone as input. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that X-Wing pinpoints portable genetic effects and substantially improves PRS performance in non-European populations, showing 14.1%–119.1% relative gain in predictive R
2
 compared to state-of-the-art methods based on GWAS summary statistics. Overall, X-Wing addresses critical limitations in existing approaches and may have broad applications in cross-population polygenic risk prediction."
680,Amniotes co-opt intrinsic genetic instability to protect germ-line genome integrity,"Unlike PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) in other species that mostly target transposable elements (TEs), >80% of piRNAs in adult mammalian testes lack obvious targets. However, mammalian piRNA sequences and piRNA-producing loci evolve more rapidly than the rest of the genome for unknown reasons. Here, through comparative studies of chickens, ducks, mice, and humans, as well as long-read nanopore sequencing on diverse chicken breeds, we find that piRNA loci across amniotes experience: (1) a high local mutation rate of structural variations (SVs, mutations ≥ 50 bp in size); (2) positive selection to suppress young and actively mobilizing TEs commencing at the pachytene stage of meiosis during germ cell development; and (3) negative selection to purge deleterious SV hotspots. Our results indicate that genetic instability at pachytene piRNA loci, while producing certain pathogenic SVs, also protects genome integrity against TE mobilization by driving the formation of rapid-evolving piRNA sequences."
681,Virtual elastography ultrasound via generative adversarial network for breast cancer diagnosis,"Elastography ultrasound (EUS) imaging is a vital ultrasound imaging modality. The current use of EUS faces many challenges, such as vulnerability to subjective manipulation, echo signal attenuation, and unknown risks of elastic pressure in certain delicate tissues. The hardware requirement of EUS also hinders the trend of miniaturization of ultrasound equipment. Here we show a cost-efficient solution by designing a deep neural network to synthesize virtual EUS (V-EUS) from conventional B-mode images. A total of 4580 breast tumor cases were collected from 15 medical centers, including a main cohort with 2501 cases for model establishment, an external dataset with 1730 cases and a portable dataset with 349 cases for testing. In the task of differentiating benign and malignant breast tumors, there is no significant difference between V-EUS and real EUS on high-end ultrasound, while the diagnostic performance of pocket-sized ultrasound can be improved by about 5% after V-EUS is equipped."
682,Direct generation of protein conformational ensembles via machine learning,"Dynamics and conformational sampling are essential for linking protein structure to biological function. While challenging to probe experimentally, computer simulations are widely used to describe protein dynamics, but at significant computational costs that continue to limit the systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning can be trained with simulation data to directly generate physically realistic conformational ensembles of proteins without the need for any sampling and at negligible computational cost. As a proof-of-principle we train a generative adversarial network based on a transformer architecture with self-attention on coarse-grained simulations of intrinsically disordered peptides. The resulting model, idpGAN, can predict sequence-dependent coarse-grained ensembles for sequences that are not present in the training set demonstrating that transferability can be achieved beyond the limited training data. We also retrain idpGAN on atomistic simulation data to show that the approach can be extended in principle to higher-resolution conformational ensemble generation."
683,Integrative proteomic characterization of adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction,"The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) has been rapidly increasing in recent decades, but its molecular alterations and subtypes are still obscure. Here, we conduct proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling of 103 AEG tumors with paired normal adjacent tissues (NATs), whole exome sequencing of 94 tumor-NAT pairs, and RNA sequencing in 83 tumor-NAT pairs. Our analysis reveals an extensively altered proteome and 252 potential druggable proteins in AEG tumors. We identify three proteomic subtypes with significant clinical and molecular differences. The S-II subtype signature protein, FBXO44, is demonstrated to promote tumor progression and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Our comparative analyses reveal distinct genomic features in AEG subtypes. We find a specific decrease of fibroblasts in the S-III subtype. Further phosphoproteomic comparisons reveal different kinase-phosphosubstrate regulatory networks among AEG subtypes. Our proteogenomics dataset provides valuable resources for understanding molecular mechanisms and developing precision treatment strategies of AEG."
684,Histone variant H2A.Z modulates nucleosome dynamics to promote DNA accessibility,"Nucleosomes, containing histone variants H2A.Z, are important for gene transcription initiation and termination, chromosome segregation and DNA double-strand break repair, among other functions. However, the underlying mechanisms of how H2A.Z influences nucleosome stability, dynamics and DNA accessibility are not well understood, as experimental and computational evidence remains inconclusive. Our modeling efforts of human nucleosome stability and dynamics, along with comparisons with experimental data show that the incorporation of H2A.Z results in a substantial decrease of the energy barrier for DNA unwrapping. This leads to the spontaneous DNA unwrapping of about forty base pairs from both ends, nucleosome gapping and increased histone plasticity, which otherwise is not observed for canonical nucleosomes. We demonstrate that both N- and C-terminal tails of H2A.Z play major roles in these events, whereas the H3.3 variant exerts a negligible impact in modulating the DNA end unwrapping. In summary, our results indicate that H2A.Z deposition makes nucleosomes more mobile and DNA more accessible to transcriptional machinery and other chromatin components."
685,A deep learning approach reveals unexplored landscape of viral expression in cancer,"About 15% of human cancer cases are attributed to viral infections. To date, virus expression in tumor tissues has been mostly studied by aligning tumor RNA sequencing reads to databases of known viruses. To allow identification of divergent viruses and rapid characterization of the tumor virome, we develop viRNAtrap, an alignment-free pipeline to identify viral reads and assemble viral contigs. We utilize viRNAtrap, which is based on a deep learning model trained to discriminate viral RNAseq reads, to explore viral expression in cancers and apply it to 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using viRNAtrap, we uncover expression of unexpected and divergent viruses that have not previously been implicated in cancer and disclose human endogenous viruses whose expression is associated with poor overall survival. The viRNAtrap pipeline provides a way forward to study viral infections associated with different clinical conditions."
686,Transcription factor binding sites are frequently under accelerated evolution in primates,"Recent comparative genomic studies have identified many human accelerated elements (HARs) with elevated substitution rates in the human lineage. However, it remains unknown to what extent transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are under accelerated evolution in humans and other primates. Here, we introduce two pooling-based phylogenetic methods with dramatically enhanced sensitivity to examine accelerated evolution in TFBSs. Using these new methods, we show that more than 6000 TFBSs annotated in the human genome have experienced accelerated evolution in Hominini, apes, and Old World monkeys. Although these TFBSs individually show relatively weak signals of accelerated evolution, they collectively are more abundant than HARs. Also, we show that accelerated evolution in Pol III binding sites may be driven by lineage-specific positive selection, whereas accelerated evolution in other TFBSs might be driven by nonadaptive evolutionary forces. Finally, the accelerated TFBSs are enriched around developmental genes, suggesting that accelerated evolution in TFBSs may drive the divergence of developmental processes between primates."
687,A spectral method for assessing and combining multiple data visualizations,"Dimension reduction is an indispensable part of modern data science, and many algorithms have been developed. However, different algorithms have their own strengths and weaknesses, making it important to evaluate their relative performance, and to leverage and combine their individual strengths. This paper proposes a spectral method for assessing and combining multiple visualizations of a given dataset produced by diverse algorithms. The proposed method provides a quantitative measure – the visualization eigenscore – of the relative performance of the visualizations for preserving the structure around each data point. It also generates a consensus visualization, having improved quality over individual visualizations in capturing the underlying structure. Our approach is flexible and works as a wrapper around any visualizations. We analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We also provide theoretical justifications based on a general statistical framework, yielding several fundamental principles along with practical guidance."
688,Genomic and microenvironmental heterogeneity shaping epithelial-to-mesenchymal trajectories in cancer,"The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key cellular process underlying cancer progression, with multiple intermediate states whose molecular hallmarks remain poorly characterised. To fill this gap, we present a method to robustly evaluate EMT transformation in individual tumours based on transcriptomic signals. We apply this approach to explore EMT trajectories in 7180 tumours of epithelial origin and identify three macro-states with prognostic and therapeutic value, attributable to epithelial, hybrid E/M and mesenchymal phenotypes. We show that the hybrid state is relatively stable and linked with increased aneuploidy. We further employ spatial transcriptomics and single cell datasets to explore the spatial heterogeneity of EMT transformation and distinct interaction patterns with cytotoxic, NK cells and fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment. Additionally, we provide a catalogue of genomic events underlying distinct evolutionary constraints on EMT transformation. This study sheds light on the aetiology of distinct stages along the EMT trajectory, and highlights broader genomic and environmental hallmarks shaping the mesenchymal transformation of primary tumours."
689,Open-source curation of a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma gene expression analysis platform (pdacR) supports a two-subtype model,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease for which potent therapies have limited efficacy. Several studies have described the transcriptomic landscape of PDAC tumors to provide insight into potentially actionable gene expression signatures to improve patient outcomes. Despite centralization efforts from multiple organizations and increased transparency requirements from funding agencies and publishers, analysis of public PDAC data remains difficult. Bioinformatic pitfalls litter public transcriptomic data, such as subtle inclusion of low-purity and non-adenocarcinoma cases. These pitfalls can introduce non-specificity to gene signatures without appropriate data curation, which can negatively impact findings. To reduce barriers to analysis, we have created pdacR (
http://pdacR.bmi.stonybrook.edu
, github.com/rmoffitt/pdacR), an open-source software package and web-tool with annotated datasets from landmark studies and an interface for user-friendly analysis in clustering, differential expression, survival, and dimensionality reduction. Using this tool, we present a multi-dataset analysis of PDAC transcriptomics that confirms the basal-like/classical model over alternatives."
690,Multilingual translation for zero-shot biomedical classification using BioTranslator,"Existing annotation paradigms rely on controlled vocabularies, where each data instance is classified into one term from a predefined set of controlled vocabularies. This paradigm restricts the analysis to concepts that are known and well-characterized. Here, we present the novel multilingual translation method BioTranslator to address this problem. BioTranslator takes a user-written textual description of a new concept and then translates this description to a non-text biological data instance. The key idea of BioTranslator is to develop a multilingual translation framework, where multiple modalities of biological data are all translated to text. We demonstrate how BioTranslator enables the identification of novel cell types using only a textual description and how BioTranslator can be further generalized to protein function prediction and drug target identification. Our tool frees scientists from limiting their analyses within predefined controlled vocabularies, enabling them to interact with biological data using free text."
691,Modeling CRISPR-Cas13d on-target and off-target effects using machine learning approaches,"A major challenge in the application of the CRISPR-Cas13d system is to accurately predict its guide-dependent on-target and off-target effect. Here, we perform CRISPR-Cas13d proliferation screens and design a deep learning model, named DeepCas13, to predict the on-target activity from guide sequences and secondary structures. DeepCas13 outperforms existing methods to predict the efficiency of guides targeting both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs. Guides targeting non-essential genes display off-target viability effects, which are closely related to their on-target efficiencies. Choosing proper negative control guides during normalization mitigates the associated false positives in proliferation screens. We apply DeepCas13 to the guides targeting lncRNAs, and identify lncRNAs that affect cell viability and proliferation in multiple cell lines. The higher prediction accuracy of DeepCas13 over existing methods is extensively confirmed via a secondary CRISPR-Cas13d screen and quantitative RT-PCR experiments. DeepCas13 is freely accessible via

692,The impacts of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose separation and targeting on the COVID-19 epidemic in England,"In late 2020, the JCVI (the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which provides advice to the Department of Health and Social Care, England) made two important recommendations for the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine. The first was that vaccines should be targeted to older and vulnerable people, with the aim of maximally preventing disease rather than infection. The second was to increase the interval between first and second doses from 3 to 12 weeks. Here, we re-examine these recommendations through a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England. We show that targeting the most vulnerable had the biggest immediate impact (compared to targeting younger individuals who may be more responsible for transmission). The 12-week delay was also highly beneficial, estimated to have averted between 32-72 thousand hospital admissions and 4-9 thousand deaths over the first ten months of the campaign (December 2020–September 2021) depending on the assumed interaction between dose interval and efficacy."
693,Two distinct binding modes provide the RNA-binding protein RbFox with extraordinary sequence specificity,"Specificity of RNA-binding proteins for target sequences varies considerably. Yet, it is not understood how certain few proteins achieve markedly higher sequence specificity than most others. Here we show that the RNA Recognition Motif of RbFox accomplishes extraordinary sequence specificity by employing functionally and structurally distinct binding modes. Affinity measurements of RbFox for all binding site variants reveal the existence of two distinct binding modes. The first exclusively accommodates cognate and closely related RNAs with high affinity. The second mode accommodates all other RNAs with reduced affinity by imposing large thermodynamic penalties on non-cognate sequences. NMR studies indicate marked structural differences between the two binding modes, including large conformational rearrangements distant from the RNA-binding site. Distinct binding modes by a single RNA-binding module explain extraordinary sequence selectivity and reveal an unknown layer of functional diversity, cross talk and regulation in RNA-protein interactions."
694,EnzymeML: seamless data flow and modeling of enzymatic data,"The design of biocatalytic reaction systems is highly complex owing to the dependency of the estimated kinetic parameters on the enzyme, the reaction conditions, and the modeling method. Consequently, reproducibility of enzymatic experiments and reusability of enzymatic data are challenging. We developed the XML-based markup language EnzymeML to enable storage and exchange of enzymatic data such as reaction conditions, the time course of the substrate and the product, kinetic parameters and the kinetic model, thus making enzymatic data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). The feasibility and usefulness of the EnzymeML toolbox is demonstrated in six scenarios, for which data and metadata of different enzymatic reactions are collected and analyzed. EnzymeML serves as a seamless communication channel between experimental platforms, electronic lab notebooks, tools for modeling of enzyme kinetics, publication platforms and enzymatic reaction databases. EnzymeML is open and transparent, and invites the community to contribute. All documents and codes are freely available at

695,Multi-omics and machine learning reveal context-specific gene regulatory activities of PML::RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia,"The PML::RARA fusion protein is the hallmark driver of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) and disrupts retinoic acid signaling, leading to wide-scale gene expression changes and uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid precursor cells. While known to be recruited to binding sites across the genome, its impact on gene regulation and expression is under-explored. Using integrated multi-omics datasets, we characterize the influence of PML::RARA binding on gene expression and regulation in an inducible PML::RARA cell line model and APL patient ex vivo samples. We find that genes whose regulatory elements recruit PML::RARA are not uniformly transcriptionally repressed, as commonly suggested, but also may be upregulated or remain unchanged. We develop a computational machine learning implementation called Regulatory Element Behavior Extraction Learning to deconvolute the complex, local transcription factor binding site environment at PML::RARA bound positions to reveal distinct signatures that modulate how PML::RARA directs the transcriptional response."
696,AlphaFold2 reveals commonalities and novelties in protein structure space for 21 model organisms,"Deep-learning (DL) methods like DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 (AF2) have led to substantial improvements in protein structure prediction. We analyse confident AF2 models from 21 model organisms using a new classification protocol (CATH-Assign) which exploits novel DL methods for structural comparison and classification. Of ~370,000 confident models, 92% can be assigned to 3253 superfamilies in our CATH domain superfamily classification. The remaining cluster into 2367 putative novel superfamilies. Detailed manual analysis on 618 of these, having at least one human relative, reveal extremely remote homologies and further unusual features. Only 25 novel superfamilies could be confirmed. Although most models map to existing superfamilies, AF2 domains expand CATH by 67% and increases the number of unique ‘global’ folds by 36% and will provide valuable insights on structure function relationships. CATH-Assign will harness the huge expansion in structural data provided by DeepMind to rationalise evolutionary changes driving functional divergence."
697,Cartography of Genomic Interactions Enables Deep Analysis of Single-Cell Expression Data,"Remarkable advances in single cell genomics have presented unique challenges and opportunities for interrogating a wealth of biomedical inquiries. High dimensional genomic data are inherently complex because of intertwined relationships among the genes. Existing methods, including emerging deep learning-based approaches, do not consider the underlying biological characteristics during data processing, which greatly compromises the performance of data analysis and hinders the maximal utilization of state-of-the-art genomic techniques. In this work, we develop an entropy-based cartography strategy to contrive the high dimensional gene expression data into a configured image format, referred to as genomap, with explicit integration of the genomic interactions. This unique cartography casts the gene-gene interactions into the spatial configuration of genomaps and enables us to extract the deep genomic interaction features and discover underlying discriminative patterns of the data. We show that, for a wide variety of applications (cell clustering and recognition, gene signature extraction, single cell data integration, cellular trajectory analysis, dimensionality reduction, and visualization), the proposed approach drastically improves the accuracies of data analyses as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques."
698,Parallelized multidimensional analytic framework applied to mammary epithelial cells uncovers regulatory principles in EMT,"A proper understanding of disease etiology will require longitudinal systems-scale reconstruction of the multitiered architecture of eukaryotic signaling. Here we combine state-of-the-art data acquisition platforms and bioinformatics tools to devise PAMAF, a workflow that simultaneously examines twelve omics modalities, i.e., protein abundance from whole-cells, nucleus, exosomes, secretome and membrane; N-glycosylation, phosphorylation; metabolites; mRNA, miRNA; and, in parallel, single-cell transcriptomes. We apply PAMAF in an established in vitro model of TGFβ-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to quantify >61,000 molecules from 12 omics and 10 timepoints over 12 days. Bioinformatics analysis of this EMT-ExMap resource allowed us to identify; –topological coupling between omics, –four distinct cell states during EMT, –omics-specific kinetic paths, –stage-specific multi-omics characteristics, –distinct regulatory classes of genes, –ligand–receptor mediated intercellular crosstalk by integrating scRNAseq and subcellular proteomics, and –combinatorial drug targets (e.g., Hedgehog signaling and CAMK-II) to inhibit EMT, which we validate using a 3D mammary duct-on-a-chip platform. Overall, this study provides a resource on TGFβ signaling and EMT."
699,Quantifying the direct and indirect protection provided by insecticide treated bed nets against malaria,"Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) provide both direct and indirect protection against malaria. As pyrethroid resistance evolves in mosquito vectors, it will be useful to understand how the specific benefits LLINs afford individuals and communities may be affected. Here we use modelling to show that there is no minimum LLIN usage needed for users and non-users to benefit from community protection. Modelling results also indicate that pyrethroid resistance in local mosquitoes will likely diminish the direct and indirect benefits from insecticides, leaving the barrier effects intact, but LLINs are still expected to provide enhanced benefit over untreated nets even at high levels of pyrethroid resistance."
700,DNA-Aeon provides flexible arithmetic coding for constraint adherence and error correction in DNA storage,"The extensive information capacity of DNA, coupled with decreasing costs for DNA synthesis and sequencing, makes DNA an attractive alternative to traditional data storage. The processes of writing, storing, and reading DNA exhibit specific error profiles and constraints DNA sequences have to adhere to. We present DNA-Aeon, a concatenated coding scheme for DNA data storage. It supports the generation of variable-sized encoded sequences with a user-defined Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content, homopolymer length limitation, and the avoidance of undesired motifs. It further enables users to provide custom codebooks adhering to further constraints. DNA-Aeon can correct substitution errors, insertions, deletions, and the loss of whole DNA strands. Comparisons with other codes show better error-correction capabilities of DNA-Aeon at similar redundancy levels with decreased DNA synthesis costs. In-vitro tests indicate high reliability of DNA-Aeon even in the case of skewed sequencing read distributions and high read-dropout."
701,An engineered variant of MECR reductase reveals indispensability of long-chain acyl-ACPs for mitochondrial respiration,"Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) is essential for respiratory function. MtFAS generates the octanoic acid precursor for lipoic acid synthesis, but the role of longer fatty acid products has remained unclear. The structurally well-characterized component of mtFAS, human 
2E
-enoyl-ACP reductase (MECR) rescues respiratory growth and lipoylation defects of a 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 Δ
etr1
 strain lacking native mtFAS enoyl reductase. To address the role of longer products of mtFAS, we employed in silico molecular simulations to design a MECR variant with a shortened substrate binding cavity. Our in vitro and in vivo analyses indicate that the MECR G165Q variant allows synthesis of octanoyl groups but not long chain fatty acids, confirming the validity of our computational approach to engineer substrate length specificity. Furthermore, our data imply that restoring lipoylation in mtFAS deficient yeast strains is not sufficient to support respiration and that long chain acyl-ACPs generated by mtFAS are required for mitochondrial function."
702,Alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association study identifies APA-linked susceptibility genes in brain disorders,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays an essential role in brain development; however, current transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) largely overlook APA in nominating susceptibility genes. Here, we performed a 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) APA TWAS (3′aTWAS) for 11 brain disorders by combining their genome-wide association studies data with 17,300 RNA-seq samples across 2,937 individuals. We identified 354 3′aTWAS-significant genes, including known APA-linked risk genes, such as 
SNCA
 in Parkinson’s disease. Among these 354 genes, ~57% are not significant in traditional expression- and splicing-TWAS studies, since APA may regulate the translation, localization and protein-protein interaction of the target genes independent of mRNA level expression or splicing. Furthermore, we discovered 
ATXN3
 as a 3′aTWAS-significant gene for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and its modulation substantially impacted pathological hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in vitro. Together, 3′aTWAS is a powerful strategy to nominate important APA-linked brain disorder susceptibility genes, most of which are largely overlooked by conventional expression and splicing analyses."
703,Estimation of cell lineages in tumors from spatial transcriptomics data,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology through in situ capturing has enabled topographical gene expression profiling of tumor tissues. However, each capturing spot may contain diverse immune and malignant cells, with different cell densities across tissue regions. Cell type deconvolution in tumor ST data remains challenging for existing methods designed to decompose general ST or bulk tumor data. We develop the Spatial Cellular Estimator for Tumors (SpaCET) to infer cell identities from tumor ST data. SpaCET first estimates cancer cell abundance by integrating a gene pattern dictionary of copy number alterations and expression changes in common malignancies. A constrained regression model then calibrates local cell densities and determines immune and stromal cell lineage fractions. SpaCET provides higher accuracy than existing methods based on simulation and real ST data with matched double-blind histopathology annotations as ground truth. Further, coupling cell fractions with ligand-receptor coexpression analysis, SpaCET reveals how intercellular interactions at the tumor-immune interface promote cancer progression."
704,Reanalysis of ribosome profiling datasets reveals a function of rocaglamide A in perturbing the dynamics of translation elongation via eIF4A,"The quickly accumulating ribosome profiling data is an insightful resource for studying the critical details of translation regulation under various biological contexts. Rocaglamide A (RocA), an antitumor heterotricyclic natural compound, has been shown to inhibit translation initiation of a large group of mRNA species by clamping eIF4A onto poly-purine motifs in the 5′ UTRs. However, reanalysis of previous ribosome profiling datasets reveals an unexpected shift of the ribosome occupancy pattern, upon RocA treatment in various types of cells, during early translation elongation for a specific group of mRNA transcripts without poly-purine motifs over-represented in their 5′ UTRs. Such perturbation of translation elongation dynamics can be attributed to the blockage of translating ribosomes due to the binding of eIF4A to the poly-purine sequence in coding regions. In summary, our study presents the complete dual modes of RocA in blocking translation initiation and elongation, which underlie the potent antitumor effect of RocA."
705,Sample multiplexing-based targeted pathway proteomics with real-time analytics reveals the impact of genetic variation on protein expression,"Targeted proteomics enables hypothesis-driven research by measuring the cellular expression of protein cohorts related by function, disease, or class after perturbation. Here, we present a pathway-centric approach and an assay builder resource for targeting entire pathways of up to 200 proteins selected from >10,000 expressed proteins to directly measure their abundances, exploiting sample multiplexing to increase throughput by 16-fold. The strategy, termed GoDig, requires only a single-shot LC-MS analysis, ~1 µg combined peptide material, a list of up to 200 proteins, and real-time analytics to trigger simultaneous quantification of up to 16 samples for hundreds of analytes. We apply GoDig to quantify the impact of genetic variation on protein expression in mice fed a high-fat diet. We create several GoDig assays to quantify the expression of multiple protein families (kinases, lipid metabolism- and lipid droplet-associated proteins) across 480 fully-genotyped Diversity Outbred mice, revealing protein quantitative trait loci and establishing potential linkages between specific proteins and lipid homeostasis."
706,Genome-wide host-pathogen analyses reveal genetic interaction points in tuberculosis disease,"The genetics underlying tuberculosis (TB) pathophysiology are poorly understood. Human genome-wide association studies have failed so far to reveal reproducible susceptibility loci, attributed in part to the influence of the underlying 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 (
Mtb
) bacterial genotype on the outcome of the infection. Several studies have found associations of human genetic polymorphisms with 
Mtb
 phylo-lineages, but studies analysing genome-genome interactions are needed. By implementing a phylogenetic tree-based 
Mtb
-to-human analysis for 714 TB patients from Thailand, we identify eight putative genetic interaction points (P < 5 × 10
−8
) including human loci DAP and RIMS3, both linked to the IFNγ cytokine and host immune system, as well as FSTL5, previously associated with susceptibility to TB. Many of the corresponding 
Mtb
 markers are lineage specific. The genome-to-genome analysis reveals a complex interactome picture, supports host-pathogen adaptation and co-evolution in TB, and has potential applications to large-scale studies across many TB endemic populations matched for host-pathogen genomic diversity."
707,An integrated multi-omics analysis of sleep-disordered breathing traits implicates P2XR4 purinergic signaling,"Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is a common disease associated with increased risk for cardiometabolic, cardiovascular, and cognitive diseases. How SDB affects the molecular environment is still poorly understood. We study the association of three SDB measures with gene expression measured using RNA-seq in multiple blood tissues from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We develop genetic instrumental variables for the associated transcripts as polygenic risk scores (tPRS), then generalize and validate the tPRS in the Women’s Health Initiative. We measure the associations of the validated tPRS with SDB and serum metabolites in Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Here we find differential gene expression by blood cell type in relation to SDB traits and link 
P2XR4
 expression to average oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep and butyrylcarnitine (C4) levels. These findings can be used to develop interventions to alleviate the effect of SDB on the human molecular environment."
708,ViralCC retrieves complete viral genomes and virus-host pairs from metagenomic Hi-C data,"The introduction of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) into metagenomics enables reconstructing high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from microbial communities. Despite recent advances in recovering eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal genomes using Hi-C contact maps, few of Hi-C-based methods are designed to retrieve viral genomes. Here we introduce ViralCC, a publicly available tool to recover complete viral genomes and detect virus-host pairs using Hi-C data. Compared to other Hi-C-based methods, ViralCC leverages the virus-host proximity structure as a complementary information source for the Hi-C interactions. Using mock and real metagenomic Hi-C datasets from several different microbial ecosystems, including the human gut, cow fecal, and wastewater, we demonstrate that ViralCC outperforms existing Hi-C-based binning methods as well as state-of-the-art tools specifically dedicated to metagenomic viral binning. ViralCC can also reveal the taxonomic structure of viruses and virus-host pairs in microbial communities. When applied to a real wastewater metagenomic Hi-C dataset, ViralCC constructs a phage-host network, which is further validated using CRISPR spacer analyses. ViralCC is an open-source pipeline available at

709,The RESP AI model accelerates the identification of tight-binding antibodies,"High-affinity antibodies are often identified through directed evolution, which may require many iterations of mutagenesis and selection to find an optimal candidate. Deep learning techniques hold the potential to accelerate this process but the existing methods cannot provide the confidence interval or uncertainty needed to assess the reliability of the predictions. Here we present a pipeline called RESP for efficient identification of high affinity antibodies. We develop a learned representation trained on over 3 million human B-cell receptor sequences to encode antibody sequences. We then develop a variational Bayesian neural network to perform ordinal regression on a set of the directed evolution sequences binned by off-rate and quantify their likelihood to be tight binders against an antigen. Importantly, this model can assess sequences not present in the directed evolution library and thus greatly expand the search space to uncover the best sequences for experimental evaluation. We demonstrate the power of this pipeline by achieving a 17-fold improvement in the 
K
D
 of the PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab and this success illustrates the potential of RESP in facilitating general antibody development."
710,Accuracy of haplotype estimation and whole genome imputation affects complex trait analyses in complex biobanks,"Sample recruitment for research consortia, biobanks, and personal genomics companies span years, necessitating genotyping in batches, using different technologies. As marker content on genotyping arrays varies, integrating such datasets is non-trivial and its impact on haplotype estimation (phasing) and whole genome imputation, necessary steps for complex trait analysis, remains under-evaluated. Using the iPSYCH dataset, comprising 130,438 individuals, genotyped in two stages, on different arrays, we evaluated phasing and imputation performance across multiple phasing methods and data integration protocols. While phasing accuracy varied by choice of method and data integration protocol, imputation accuracy varied mostly between data integration protocols. We demonstrate an attenuation in imputation accuracy within samples of non-European origin, highlighting challenges to studying complex traits in diverse populations. Finally, imputation errors can bias association tests, reduce predictive utility of polygenic scores. Carefully optimized data integration strategies enhance accuracy and replicability of complex trait analyses in complex biobanks."
711,Mapping lesion-specific response and progression dynamics and inter-organ variability in metastatic colorectal cancer,"Achieving systemic tumor control across metastases is vital for long-term patient survival but remains intractable in many patients. High lesion-level response heterogeneity persists, conferring many dissociated responses across metastatic lesions. Most studies of metastatic disease focus on tumor molecular and cellular features, which are crucial to elucidating the mechanisms underlying lesion-level variability. However, our understanding of lesion-specific heterogeneity on the macroscopic level, such as lesion dynamics in growth, response, and progression during treatment, remains rudimentary. This study investigates lesion-specific response heterogeneity through analyzing 116,542 observations of 40,612 lesions in 4,308 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Despite significant differences in their response and progression dynamics, metastatic lesions converge on four phenotypes that vary with anatomical site. Importantly, we find that organ-level progression sequence is closely associated with patient long-term survival, and that patients with the first lesion progression in the liver often have worse survival. In conclusion, our study provides insights into lesion-specific response and progression heterogeneity in mCRC and creates impetus for metastasis-specific therapeutics."
712,Decision level integration of unimodal and multimodal single cell data with scTriangulate,"Decisively delineating cell identities from uni- and multimodal single-cell datasets is complicated by diverse modalities, clustering methods, and reference atlases. We describe scTriangulate, a computational framework to mix-and-match multiple clustering results, modalities, associated algorithms, and resolutions to achieve an optimal solution. Rather than ensemble approaches which select the “consensus”, scTriangulate picks the most stable solution through coalitional iteration. When evaluated on diverse multimodal technologies, scTriangulate outperforms alternative approaches to identify high-confidence cell-populations and modality-specific subtypes. Unlike existing integration strategies that rely on modality-specific joint embedding or geometric graphs, scTriangulate makes no assumption about the distributions of raw underlying values. As a result, this approach can solve unprecedented integration challenges, including the ability to automate reference cell-atlas construction, resolve clonal architecture within molecularly defined cell-populations and subdivide clusters to discover splicing-defined disease subtypes. scTriangulate is a flexible strategy for unified integration of single-cell or multimodal clustering solutions, from nearly unlimited sources."
713,Topological identification and interpretation for single-cell gene regulation elucidation across multiple platforms using scMGCA,"Single-cell RNA sequencing provides high-throughput gene expression information to explore cellular heterogeneity at the individual cell level. A major challenge in characterizing high-throughput gene expression data arises from challenges related to dimensionality, and the prevalence of dropout events. To address these concerns, we develop a deep graph learning method, scMGCA, for single-cell data analysis. scMGCA is based on a graph-embedding autoencoder that simultaneously learns cell-cell topology representation and cluster assignments. We show that scMGCA is accurate and effective for cell segregation and batch effect correction, outperforming other state-of-the-art models across multiple platforms. In addition, we perform genomic interpretation on the key compressed transcriptomic space of the graph-embedding autoencoder to demonstrate the underlying gene regulation mechanism. We demonstrate that in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma dataset, scMGCA successfully provides annotations on the specific cell types and reveals differential gene expression levels across multiple tumor-associated and cell signalling pathways."
714,Epigenetic and transcriptional regulations prime cell fate before division during human pluripotent stem cell differentiation,"Stem cells undergo cellular division during their differentiation to produce daughter cells with a new cellular identity. However, the epigenetic events and molecular mechanisms occurring between consecutive cell divisions have been insufficiently studied due to technical limitations. Here, using the FUCCI reporter we developed a cell-cycle synchronised human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation system for uncovering epigenome and transcriptome dynamics during the first two divisions leading to definitive endoderm. We observed that transcription of key differentiation markers occurs before cell division, while chromatin accessibility analyses revealed the early inhibition of alternative cell fates. We found that Activator protein-1 members controlled by p38/MAPK signalling are necessary for inducing endoderm while blocking cell fate shifting toward mesoderm, and that enhancers are rapidly established and decommissioned between different cell divisions. Our study has practical biomedical utility for producing hPSC-derived patient-specific cell types since p38/MAPK induction increased the differentiation efficiency of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells."
715,Projected health impact of post-discharge malaria chemoprevention among children with severe malarial anaemia in Africa,"Children recovering from severe malarial anaemia (SMA) remain at high risk of readmission and death after discharge from hospital. However, a recent trial found that post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine reduces this risk. We developed a mathematical model describing the daily incidence of uncomplicated and severe malaria requiring readmission among 0–5-year old children after hospitalised SMA. We fitted the model to a multicentre clinical PDMC trial using Bayesian methods and modelled the potential impact of PDMC across malaria-endemic African countries. In the 20 highest-burden countries, we estimate that only 2–5 children need to be given PDMC to prevent one hospitalised malaria episode, and less than 100 to prevent one death. If all hospitalised SMA cases access PDMC in moderate-to-high transmission areas, 38,600 (range 16,900–88,400) malaria-associated readmissions could be prevented annually, depending on access to hospital care. We estimate that recurrent SMA post-discharge constitutes 19% of all SMA episodes in moderate-to-high transmission settings."
716,scMoMaT jointly performs single cell mosaic integration and multi-modal bio-marker detection,"Single cell data integration methods aim to integrate cells across data batches and modalities, and data integration tasks can be categorized into horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and mosaic integration, where mosaic integration is the most general and challenging case with few methods developed. We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic integration scenario using matrix tri-factorization. During integration, scMoMaT is also able to uncover the cluster specific bio-markers across modalities. These multi-modal bio-markers are used to interpret and annotate the clusters to cell types. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type compositions. Applying scMoMaT to multiple real and simulated datasets demonstrated these features of scMoMaT and showed that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to existing methods. Specifically, we show that integrated cell embedding combined with learned bio-markers lead to cell type annotations of higher quality or resolution compared to their original annotations."
717,A temporal classifier predicts histopathology state and parses acute-chronic phasing in inflammatory bowel disease patients,"Previous studies have conducted time course characterization of murine colitis models through transcriptional profiling of differential expression. We characterize the transcriptional landscape of acute and chronic models of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and adoptive transfer (AT) colitis to derive temporal gene expression and splicing signatures in blood and colonic tissue in order to capture dynamics of colitis remission and relapse. We identify sub networks of patient-derived causal networks that are enriched in these temporal signatures to distinguish acute and chronic disease components within the broader molecular landscape of IBD. The interaction between the DSS phenotype and chronological time-point naturally defines parsimonious temporal gene expression and splicing signatures associated with acute and chronic phases disease (as opposed to ordinary time-specific differential expression/splicing). We show these expression and splicing signatures are largely orthogonal, i.e. affect different genetic bodies, and that using machine learning, signatures are predictive of histopathological measures from both blood and intestinal data in murine colitis models as well as an independent cohort of IBD patients. Through access to longitudinal multi-scale profiling from disease tissue in IBD patient cohorts, we can apply this machine learning pipeline to generation of direct patient temporal multimodal regulatory signatures for prediction of histopathological outcomes."
718,Murine breast cancers disorganize the liver transcriptome in a zonated manner,"The spatially organized gene expression program within the liver specifies hepatocyte functions according to their relative distances to the bloodstream (i.e., zonation), contributing to liver homeostasis. Despite the knowledge that solid cancers remotely disrupt liver homeostasis, it remains unexplored whether solid cancers affect liver zonation. Here, using spatial transcriptomics, we thoroughly investigate the abundance and zonation of hepatic genes in cancer-bearing mice. We find that breast cancers affect liver zonation in various distinct manners depending on biological pathways. Aspartate metabolism and triglyceride catabolic processes retain relatively intact zonation patterns, but the zonation of xenobiotic catabolic process genes exhibits a strong disruption. The acute phase response is induced in zonated manners. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breast cancers activate innate immune cells in particular neutrophils in distinct zonated manners, rather than in a uniform fashion within the liver. Collectively, breast cancers disorganize hepatic transcriptomes in zonated manners, thereby disrupting zonated functions of the liver."
719,Convolutional networks for supervised mining of molecular patterns within cellular context,"Cryo-electron tomograms capture a wealth of structural information on the molecular constituents of cells and tissues. We present DeePiCt (deep picker in context), an open-source deep-learning framework for supervised segmentation and macromolecular complex localization in cryo-electron tomography. To train and benchmark DeePiCt on experimental data, we comprehensively annotated 20 tomograms of 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe
 for ribosomes, fatty acid synthases, membranes, nuclear pore complexes, organelles, and cytosol. By comparing DeePiCt to state-of-the-art approaches on this dataset, we show its unique ability to identify low-abundance and low-density complexes. We use DeePiCt to study compositionally distinct subpopulations of cellular ribosomes, with emphasis on their contextual association with mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, applying pre-trained networks to a HeLa cell tomogram demonstrates that DeePiCt achieves high-quality predictions in unseen datasets from different biological species in a matter of minutes. The comprehensively annotated experimental data and pre-trained networks are provided for immediate use by the community."
720,Screening cell–cell communication in spatial transcriptomics via collective optimal transport,"Spatial transcriptomic technologies and spatially annotated single-cell RNA sequencing datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect cell–cell communication (CCC). However, incorporation of the spatial information and complex biochemical processes required in the reconstruction of CCC remains a major challenge. Here, we present COMMOT (COMMunication analysis by Optimal Transport) to infer CCC in spatial transcriptomics, which accounts for the competition between different ligand and receptor species as well as spatial distances between cells. A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply COMMOT to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial CCC in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Finally, COMMOT identifies new CCCs during skin morphogenesis in a case study of human epidermal development."
721,Single-cell profiling reveals differences between human classical adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma,"Colorectal cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Most colorectal cancers are classical adenocarcinoma, and mucinous adenocarcinoma is a unique histological subtype that is known to respond poorly to chemoradiotherapy. The difference in prognosis between mucinous adenocarcinoma and classical adenocarcinoma is controversial. Here, to gain insight into the differences between classical adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma, we analyse 7 surgical tumour samples from 4 classical adenocarcinoma and 3 mucinous adenocarcinoma patients by single-cell RNA sequencing. Our results indicate that mucinous adenocarcinoma cancer cells have goblet cell-like properties, and express high levels of goblet cell markers (
REG4
, 
SPINK4
, 
FCGBP
 and 
MUC2
) compared to classical adenocarcinoma cancer cells. 
TFF3
 is essential for the transcriptional regulation of these molecules, and may cooperate with 
RPS4X
 to eventually lead to the mucinous adenocarcinoma mucus phenotype. The observed molecular characteristics may be critical in the specific biological behavior of mucinous adenocarcinoma."
722,MiXcan: a framework for cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide association studies with an application to breast cancer,"Human bulk tissue samples comprise multiple cell types with diverse roles in disease etiology. Conventional transcriptome-wide association study approaches predict genetically regulated gene expression at the tissue level, without considering cell-type heterogeneity, and test associations of predicted tissue-level expression with disease. Here we develop MiXcan, a cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide association study approach that predicts cell-type-level expression, identifies disease-associated genes via combination of cell-type-level association signals for multiple cell types, and provides insight into the disease-critical cell type. As a proof of concept, we conducted cell-type-aware analyses of breast cancer in 58,648 women and identified 12 transcriptome-wide significant genes using MiXcan compared with only eight genes using conventional approaches. Importantly, MiXcan identified genes with distinct associations in mammary epithelial versus stromal cells, including three new breast cancer susceptibility genes. These findings demonstrate that cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide analyses can reveal new insights into the genetic and cellular etiology of breast cancer and other diseases."
723,Single-cell RNA binding protein regulatory network analyses reveal oncogenic HNRNPK-MYC signalling pathway in cancer,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of gene expression and perturbations of RBP-RNA regulatory network have been observed in various cancer types. Here, we propose a computational method, RBPreg, to identify the RBP regulators by integration of single cell RNA-Seq (N = 233,591) and RBP binding data. Pan-cancer analyses suggest that RBP regulators exhibit cancer and cell specificity and perturbations of RBP regulatory network are involved in cancer hallmark-related functions. We prioritize an oncogenic RBP-HNRNPK, which is highly expressed in tumors and associated with poor prognosis of patients. Functional assays performed in cancer cells reveal that HNRNPK promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations further demonstrate that HNRNPK promotes tumorigenesis and progression by directly binding to MYC and perturbed the MYC targets pathway in lung cancer. Our results provide a valuable resource for characterizing RBP regulatory networks in cancer, yielding potential biomarkers for precision medicine."
724,Machine learning identifies T cell receptor repertoire signatures associated with COVID-19 severity,"T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are critical for antiviral immunity. Determining the TCR repertoire composition, diversity, and dynamics and how they change during viral infection can inform the molecular specificity of host responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. To determine signatures associated with COVID-19 disease severity, here we perform a large-scale analysis of over 4.7 billion sequences across 2130 TCR repertoires from COVID-19 patients and healthy donors. TCR repertoire analyses from these data identify and characterize convergent COVID-19-associated CDR3 gene usages, specificity groups, and sequence patterns. Here we show that T cell clonal expansion is associated with the upregulation of T cell effector function, TCR signaling, NF-kB signaling, and interferon-gamma signaling pathways. We also demonstrate that machine learning approaches accurately predict COVID-19 infection based on TCR sequence features, with certain high-power models reaching near-perfect AUROC scores. These analyses provide a systems immunology view of T cell adaptive immune responses to COVID-19."
725,Learning the protein language of proteome-wide protein-protein binding sites via explainable ensemble deep learning,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) govern cellular pathways and processes, by significantly influencing the functional expression of proteins. Therefore, accurate identification of protein-protein interaction binding sites has become a key step in the functional analysis of proteins. However, since most computational methods are designed based on biological features, there are no available protein language models to directly encode amino acid sequences into distributed vector representations to model their characteristics for protein-protein binding events. Moreover, the number of experimentally detected protein interaction sites is much smaller than that of protein-protein interactions or protein sites in protein complexes, resulting in unbalanced data sets that leave room for improvement in their performance. To address these problems, we develop an ensemble deep learning model (EDLM)-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) site identification method (EDLMPPI). Evaluation results show that EDLMPPI outperforms state-of-the-art techniques including several PPI site prediction models on three widely-used benchmark datasets including Dset_448, Dset_72, and Dset_164, which demonstrated that EDLMPPI is superior to those PPI site prediction models by nearly 10% in terms of average precision. In addition, the biological and interpretable analyses provide new insights into protein binding site identification and characterization mechanisms from different perspectives. The EDLMPPI webserver is available at

726,"Plagued by a cryptic clock: insight and issues from the global phylogeny of 
Yersinia pestis","Plague has an enigmatic history as a zoonotic pathogen. This infectious disease will unexpectedly appear in human populations and disappear just as suddenly. As a result, a long-standing line of inquiry has been to estimate when and where plague appeared in the past. However, there have been significant disparities between phylogenetic studies of the causative bacterium, 
Yersinia pestis
, regarding the timing and geographic origins of its reemergence. Here, we curate and contextualize an updated phylogeny of 
Y. pestis
 using 601 genome sequences sampled globally. Through a detailed Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal in subsets of these data we demonstrate that a 
Y. pestis
-wide molecular clock is unstable. To resolve this, we developed a new approach in which each 
Y. pestis
 population was assessed independently, enabling us to recover substantial temporal signal in five populations, including the ancient pandemic lineages which we now estimate may have emerged decades, or even centuries, before a pandemic was historically documented from European sources. Despite this methodological advancement, we only obtain robust divergence dates from populations sampled over a period of at least 90 years, indicating that genetic evidence alone is insufficient for accurately reconstructing the timing and spread of short-term plague epidemics."
727,Jasmine and Iris: population-scale structural variant comparison and analysis,"The availability of long reads is revolutionizing studies of structural variants (SVs). However, because SVs vary across individuals and are discovered through imprecise read technologies and methods, they can be difficult to compare. Addressing this, we present Jasmine and Iris (
https://github.com/mkirsche/Jasmine/
), for fast and accurate SV refinement, comparison and population analysis. Using an SV proximity graph, Jasmine outperforms six widely used comparison methods, including reducing the rate of Mendelian discordance in trio datasets by more than fivefold, and reveals a set of high-confidence de novo SVs confirmed by multiple technologies. We also present a unified callset of 122,813 SVs and 82,379 indels from 31 samples of diverse ancestry sequenced with long reads. We genotype these variants in 1,317 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project with DNA and RNA-sequencing data and assess their widespread impact on gene expression, including within medically relevant genes."
728,Molecular characterization of Richter syndrome identifies de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with poor prognosis,"Richter syndrome (RS) is the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We characterize 58 primary human RS samples by genome-wide DNA methylation and whole-transcriptome profiling. Our comprehensive approach determines RS DNA methylation profile and unravels a CLL epigenetic imprint, allowing CLL-RS clonal relationship assessment without the need of the initial CLL tumor DNA. DNA methylation
-
 and transcriptomic-based classifiers were developed, and testing on landmark DLBCL datasets identifies a poor-prognosis, activated B-cell-like DLBCL subset in 111/1772 samples. The classification robustly identifies phenotypes very similar to RS with a specific genomic profile, accounting for 4.3-8.3% of de novo DLBCLs. In this work, RS multi-omics characterization determines oncogenic mechanisms, establishes a surrogate marker for CLL-RS clonal relationship, and provides a clinically relevant classifier for a subset of primary “RS-type DLBCL” with unfavorable prognosis."
729,Annotation of natural product compound families using molecular networking topology and structural similarity fingerprinting,"Spectral matching of MS
2
 fragmentation spectra has become a popular method for characterizing natural products libraries but identification remains challenging due to differences in MS
2
 fragmentation properties between instruments and the low coverage of current spectral reference libraries. To address this bottleneck we present Structural similarity Network Annotation Platform for Mass Spectrometry (SNAP-MS) which matches chemical similarity grouping in the Natural Products Atlas to grouping of mass spectrometry features from molecular networking. This approach assigns compound families to molecular networking subnetworks without the need for experimental or calculated reference spectra. We demonstrate SNAP-MS can accurately annotate subnetworks built from both reference spectra and an in-house microbial extract library, and correctly predict compound families from published molecular networks acquired on a range of MS instrumentation. Compound family annotations for the microbial extract library are validated by co-injection of standards or isolation and spectroscopic analysis. SNAP-MS is freely available at

730,"Probabilistic embedding, clustering, and alignment for integrating spatial transcriptomics data with PRECAST","Spatially resolved transcriptomics involves a set of emerging technologies that enable the transcriptomic profiling of tissues with the physical location of expressions. Although a variety of methods have been developed for data integration, most of them are for single-cell RNA-seq datasets without consideration of spatial information. Thus, methods that can integrate spatial transcriptomics data from multiple tissue slides, possibly from multiple individuals, are needed. Here, we present PRECAST, a data integration method for multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets with complex batch effects and/or biological effects between slides. PRECAST unifies spatial factor analysis simultaneously with spatial clustering and embedding alignment, while requiring only partially shared cell/domain clusters across datasets. Using both simulated and four real datasets, we show improved cell/domain detection with outstanding visualization, and the estimated aligned embeddings and cell/domain labels facilitate many downstream analyses. We demonstrate that PRECAST is computationally scalable and applicable to spatial transcriptomics datasets from different platforms."
731,Deciphering the exact breakpoints of structural variations using long sequencing reads with DeBreak,"Long-read sequencing has demonstrated great potential for characterizing all types of structural variations (SVs). However, existing algorithms have insufficient sensitivity and precision. To address these limitations, we present DeBreak, a computational method for comprehensive and accurate SV discovery. Based on alignment results, DeBreak employs a density-based approach for clustering SV candidates together with a local de novo assembly approach for reconstructing long insertions. A partial order alignment algorithm ensures precise SV breakpoints with single base-pair resolution, and a 
k
-means clustering method can report multi-allele SV events. DeBreak outperforms existing tools on both simulated and real long-read sequencing data from both PacBio and Nanopore platforms. An important application of DeBreak is analyzing cancer genomes for potentially tumor-driving SVs. DeBreak can also be used for supplementing whole-genome assembly-based SV discovery."
732,Dynamics of CLIMP-63 S-acylation control ER morphology,"The complex architecture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises distinct dynamic features, many at the nanoscale, that enable the coexistence of the nuclear envelope, regions of dense sheets and a branched tubular network that spans the cytoplasm. A key player in the formation of ER sheets is cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63 (CLIMP-63). The mechanisms by which CLIMP-63 coordinates ER structure remain elusive. Here, we address the impact of S-acylation, a reversible post-translational lipid modification, on CLIMP-63 cellular distribution and function. Combining native mass-spectrometry, with kinetic analysis of acylation and deacylation, and data-driven mathematical modelling, we obtain in-depth understanding of the CLIMP-63 life cycle. In the ER, it assembles into trimeric units. These occasionally exit the ER to reach the plasma membrane. However, the majority undergoes S-acylation by ZDHHC6 in the ER where they further assemble into highly stable super-complexes. Using super-resolution microscopy and focused ion beam electron microscopy, we show that CLIMP-63 acylation-deacylation controls the abundance and fenestration of ER sheets. Overall, this study uncovers a dynamic lipid post-translational regulation of ER architecture."
733,BMI-adjusted adipose tissue volumes exhibit depot-specific and divergent associations with cardiometabolic diseases,"For any given body mass index (BMI), individuals vary substantially in fat distribution, and this variation may have important implications for cardiometabolic risk. Here, we study disease associations with BMI-independent variation in visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), and gluteofemoral (GFAT) fat depots in 40,032 individuals of the UK Biobank with body MRI. We apply deep learning models based on two-dimensional body MRI projections to enable near-perfect estimation of fat depot volumes (R
2
 in heldout dataset = 0.978-0.991 for VAT, ASAT, and GFAT). Next, we derive BMI-adjusted metrics for each fat depot (e.g. VAT adjusted for BMI, VATadjBMI) to quantify local adiposity burden. VATadjBMI is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, ASATadjBMI is largely neutral, and GFATadjBMI is associated with reduced risk. These results – describing three metabolically distinct fat depots at scale – clarify the cardiometabolic impact of BMI-independent differences in body fat distribution."
734,Haplotype-aware pantranscriptome analyses using spliced pangenome graphs,"Pangenomics is emerging as a powerful computational paradigm in bioinformatics. This field uses population-level genome reference structures, typically consisting of a sequence graph, to mitigate reference bias and facilitate analyses that were challenging with previous reference-based methods. In this work, we extend these methods into transcriptomics to analyze sequencing data using the pantranscriptome: a population-level transcriptomic reference. Our toolchain, which consists of additions to the VG toolkit and a standalone tool, RPVG, can construct spliced pangenome graphs, map RNA sequencing data to these graphs, and perform haplotype-aware expression quantification of transcripts in a pantranscriptome. We show that this workflow improves accuracy over state-of-the-art RNA sequencing mapping methods, and that it can efficiently quantify haplotype-specific transcript expression without needing to characterize the haplotypes of a sample beforehand."
735,Single molecule imaging simulations with advanced fluorophore photophysics,"Advanced fluorescence imaging techniques such as single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) fundamentally rely on the photophysical behavior of the employed fluorophores. This behavior is generally complex and impacts data quality in a subtle manner. A simulation software named Single-Molecule Imaging Simulator (SMIS) is introduced that simulates a widefield microscope and incorporates fluorophores with their spectral and photophysical properties. With SMIS, data collection schemes combining 3D, multicolor, single-particle-tracking or quantitative SMLM can be implemented. The influence of advanced fluorophore characteristics, imaging conditions, and environmental parameters can be evaluated, facilitating the design of real experiments and their proper interpretation."
736,"Comparative analysis of genome-scale, base-resolution DNA methylation profiles across 580 animal species","Methylation of cytosines is a prototypic epigenetic modification of the DNA. It has been implicated in various regulatory mechanisms across the animal kingdom and particularly in vertebrates. We mapped DNA methylation in 580 animal species (535 vertebrates, 45 invertebrates), resulting in 2443 genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of multiple organs. Bioinformatic analysis of this large dataset quantified the association of DNA methylation with the underlying genomic DNA sequence throughout vertebrate evolution. We observed a broadly conserved link with two major transitions—once in the first vertebrates and again with the emergence of reptiles. Cross-species comparisons focusing on individual organs supported a deeply conserved association of DNA methylation with tissue type, and cross-mapping analysis of DNA methylation at gene promoters revealed evolutionary changes for orthologous genes. In summary, this study establishes a large resource of vertebrate and invertebrate DNA methylomes, it showcases the power of reference-free epigenome analysis in species for which no reference genomes are available, and it contributes an epigenetic perspective to the study of vertebrate evolution."
737,Transformer for one stop interpretable cell type annotation,"Consistent annotation transfer from reference dataset to query dataset is fundamental to the development and reproducibility of single-cell research. Compared with traditional annotation methods, deep learning based methods are faster and more automated. A series of useful single cell analysis tools based on autoencoder architecture have been developed but these struggle to strike a balance between depth and interpretability. Here, we present TOSICA, a multi-head self-attention deep learning model based on Transformer that enables interpretable cell type annotation using biologically understandable entities, such as pathways or regulons. We show that TOSICA achieves fast and accurate one-stop annotation and batch-insensitive integration while providing biologically interpretable insights for understanding cellular behavior during development and disease progressions. We demonstrate TOSICA’s advantages by applying it to scRNA-seq data of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and CD14+ monocytes in COVID-19 to reveal rare cell types, heterogeneity and dynamic trajectories associated with disease progression and severity."
738,A genome-wide association study identifies distinct variants associated with pulmonary function among European and African ancestries from the UK Biobank,"Pulmonary function is an indicator of well-being, and pulmonary pathologies are the third major cause of death worldwide. We analysed the UK Biobank genome-wide association summary statistics of pulmonary function for Europeans and individuals of recent African descent to identify variants associated with the trait in the two ancestries. Here, we show 627 variants in Europeans and 3 in Africans associated with three pulmonary function parameters. In addition to the 110 variants in Europeans previously reported to be associated with phenotypes related to pulmonary function, we identify 279 novel loci, including an 
ISX
 intergenic variant rs369476290 on chromosome 22 in Africans. Remarkably, we find no shared variants among Africans and Europeans. Furthermore, enrichment analyses of variants separately for each ancestry background reveal significant enrichment for terms related to pulmonary phenotypes in Europeans but not Africans. Further analysis of studies of pulmonary phenotypes reveals that individuals of European background are disproportionally overrepresented in datasets compared to Africans, with the gap widening over the past five years. Our findings extend our understanding of the different variants that modify the pulmonary function in Africans and Europeans, a promising finding for future GWASs and medical studies."
739,Levofloxacin prophylaxis and parenteral nutrition have a detrimental effect on intestinal microbial networks in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT,"The gut microbiome (GM) has shown to influence hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcome. Evidence on levofloxacin (LVX) prophylaxis usefulness before HSCT in pediatric patients is controversial and its impact on GM is poorly characterized. Post-HSCT parenteral nutrition (PN) is oftentimes the first-line nutritional support in the neutropenic phase, despite the emerging benefits of enteral nutrition (EN). In this exploratory work, we used a global-to-local networking approach to obtain a high-resolution longitudinal characterization of the GM in 30 pediatric HSCT patients receiving PN combined with LVX prophylaxis or PN alone or EN alone. By evaluating the network topology, we found that PN, especially preceded by LVX prophylaxis, resulted in a detrimental effect over the GM, with low modularity, poor cohesion, a shift in keystone species and the emergence of modules comprising several pathobionts, such as 
Klebsiella
 spp., 
[Ruminococcus] gnavus
, 
Flavonifractor plautii
 and 
Enterococcus faecium
. Our pilot findings on LVX prophylaxis and PN-related disruption of GM networks should be considered in patient management, to possibly facilitate prompt recovery/maintenance of a healthy and well-wired GM. However, the impact of LVX prophylaxis and nutritional support on short- to long-term post-HSCT clinical outcomes has yet to be elucidated."
740,GALA: a computational framework for de novo chromosome-by-chromosome assembly with long reads,"High-quality genome assembly has wide applications in genetics and medical studies. However, it is still very challenging to achieve gap-free chromosome-scale assemblies using current workflows for long-read platforms. Here we report on GALA (
Ga
p-free 
l
ong-read 
A
ssembly tool), a computational framework for chromosome-based sequencing data separation and de novo assembly implemented through a multi-layer graph that identifies discordances within preliminary assemblies and partitions the data into chromosome-scale scaffolding groups. The subsequent independent assembly of each scaffolding group generates a gap-free assembly likely free from the mis-assembly errors which usually hamper existing workflows. This flexible framework also allows us to integrate data from various technologies, such as Hi-C, genetic maps, and even motif analyses to generate gap-free chromosome-scale assemblies. As a proof of principle we de novo assemble the 
C. elegans
 genome using combined PacBio and Nanopore sequencing data and a rice cultivar genome using Nanopore sequencing data from publicly available datasets. We also demonstrate the proposed method’s applicability with a gap-free assembly of the human genome using PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads. Thus, our method enables straightforward assembly of genomes with multiple data sources and overcomes barriers that at present restrict the application of de novo genome assembly technology."
741,Estimating conformational landscapes from Cryo-EM particles by 3D Zernike polynomials,"The new developments in Cryo-EM Single Particle Analysis are helping us to understand how the macromolecular structure and function meet to drive biological processes. By capturing many states at the particle level, it is possible to address how macromolecules explore different conformations, information that is classically extracted through 3D classification. However, the limitations of classical approaches prevent us from fully understanding the complete conformational landscape due to the reduced number of discrete states accurately reconstructed. To characterize the whole structural spectrum of a macromolecule, we propose an extension of our Zernike3D approach, able to extract per-image continuous flexibility information directly from a particle dataset. Also, our method can be seamlessly applied to images, maps or atomic models, opening integrative possibilities. Furthermore, we introduce the ZART reconstruction algorithm, which considers the Zernike3D deformation fields to revert particle conformational changes during the reconstruction process, thus minimizing the blurring induced by molecular motions."
742,Robust single-cell matching and multimodal analysis using shared and distinct features,"The ability to align individual cellular information from multiple experimental sources is fundamental for a systems-level understanding of biological processes. However, currently available tools are mainly designed for single-cell transcriptomics matching and integration, and generally rely on a large number of shared features across datasets for cell matching. This approach underperforms when applied to single-cell proteomic datasets due to the limited number of parameters simultaneously accessed and lack of shared markers across these experiments. Here, we introduce a cell-matching algorithm, matching with partial overlap (MARIO) that accounts for both shared and distinct features, while consisting of vital filtering steps to avoid suboptimal matching. MARIO accurately matches and integrates data from different single-cell proteomic and multimodal methods, including spatial techniques and has cross-species capabilities. MARIO robustly matched tissue macrophages identified from COVID-19 lung autopsies via codetection by indexing imaging to macrophages recovered from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, revealing unique immune responses within the lung microenvironment of patients with COVID."
743,Thermodynamic architecture and conformational plasticity of GPCRs,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are ubiquitous integral membrane proteins involved in diverse cellular signaling processes. Here, we carry out a large-scale ensemble thermodynamic study of 45 ligand-free GPCRs employing a structure-based statistical mechanical framework. We find that multiple partially structured states co-exist in the GPCR native ensemble, with the TM helices 1, 6 and 7 displaying varied folding status, and shaping the conformational landscape. Strongly coupled residues are anisotropically distributed, accounting for only 13% of the residues, illustrating that a large number of residues are inherently dynamic. Active-state GPCRs are characterized by reduced conformational heterogeneity with altered coupling-patterns distributed throughout the structural scaffold. In silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis reveals that extra- and intra-cellular faces of GPCRs are coupled thermodynamically, highlighting an exquisite structural specialization and the fluid nature of the intramolecular interaction network. The ensemble-based perturbation methodology presented here lays the foundation for understanding allosteric mechanisms and the effects of disease-causing mutations in GCPRs."
744,Phase-separating pyrenoid proteins form complexes in the dilute phase,"While most studies of biomolecular phase separation have focused on the condensed phase, relatively little is known about the dilute phase. Theory suggests that stable complexes form in the dilute phase of two-component phase-separating systems, impacting phase separation; however, these complexes have not been interrogated experimentally. We show that such complexes indeed exist, using an in vitro reconstitution system of a phase-separated organelle, the algal pyrenoid, consisting of purified proteins Rubisco and EPYC1. Applying fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to measure diffusion coefficients, we found that complexes form in the dilute phase with or without condensates present. The majority of these complexes contain exactly one Rubisco molecule. Additionally, we developed a simple analytical model which recapitulates experimental findings and provides molecular insights into the dilute phase organization. Thus, our results demonstrate the existence of protein complexes in the dilute phase, which could play important roles in the stability, dynamics, and regulation of condensates."
745,Direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in Switzerland,"The direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population-level mortality is of concern to public health but challenging to quantify. Using data for 2011–2019, we applied Bayesian models to predict the expected number of deaths in Switzerland and compared them with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths from February 2020 to April 2022 (study period). We estimated that COVID-19-related mortality was underestimated by a factor of 0.72 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.46–0.78). After accounting for COVID-19 deaths, the observed mortality was −4% (95% CrI: −8 to 0) lower than expected. The deficit in mortality was concentrated in age groups 40–59 (−12%, 95%CrI: −19 to −5) and 60–69 (−8%, 95%CrI: −15 to −2). Although COVID-19 control measures may have negative effects, after subtracting COVID-19 deaths, there were fewer deaths in Switzerland during the pandemic than expected, suggesting that any negative effects of control measures were offset by the positive effects. These results have important implications for the ongoing debate about the appropriateness of COVID-19 control measures."
746,Benchmarking commonly used software suites and analysis workflows for DIA proteomics and phosphoproteomics,"A plethora of software suites and multiple classes of spectral libraries have been developed to enhance the depth and robustness of data-independent acquisition (DIA) data processing. However, how the combination of a DIA software tool and a spectral library impacts the outcome of DIA proteomics and phosphoproteomics data analysis has been rarely investigated using benchmark data that mimics biological complexity. In this study, we create DIA benchmark data sets simulating the regulation of thousands of proteins in a complex background, which are collected on both an Orbitrap and a timsTOF instruments. We evaluate four commonly used software suites (DIA-NN, Spectronaut, MaxDIA and Skyline) combined with seven different spectral libraries in global proteome analysis. Moreover, we assess their performances in analyzing phosphopeptide standards and TNF-α-induced phosphoproteome regulation. Our study provides a practical guidance on how to construct a robust data analysis pipeline for different proteomics studies implementing the DIA technique."
747,A Bayesian model for unsupervised detection of RNA splicing based subtypes in cancers,"Identification of cancer sub-types is a pivotal step for developing personalized treatment. Specifically, sub-typing based on changes in RNA splicing has been motivated by several recent studies. We thus develop CHESSBOARD, an unsupervised algorithm tailored for RNA splicing data that captures “tiles” in the data, defined by a subset of unique splicing changes in a subset of patients. CHESSBOARD allows for a flexible number of tiles, accounts for uncertainty of splicing quantification, and is able to model missing values as additional signals. We first apply CHESSBOARD to synthetic data to assess its domain specific modeling advantages, followed by analysis of several leukemia datasets. We show detected tiles are reproducible in independent studies, investigate their possible regulatory drivers and probe their relation to known AML mutations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential clinical utility of CHESSBOARD by supplementing mutation based diagnostic assays with discovered splicing profiles to improve drug response correlation."
748,Rare variant analyses across multiethnic cohorts identify novel genes for refractive error,"Refractive error, measured here as mean spherical equivalent (SER), is a complex eye condition caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Individuals with strong positive or negative values of SER require spectacles or other approaches for vision correction. Common genetic risk factors have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but a great part of the refractive error heritability is still missing. Some of this heritability may be explained by rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≤ 0.01.). We performed multiple gene-based association tests of mean Spherical Equivalent with rare variants in exome array data from the Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM). The dataset consisted of over 27,000 total subjects from five cohorts of Indo-European and Eastern Asian ethnicity. We identified 129 unique genes associated with refractive error, many of which were replicated in multiple cohorts. Our best novel candidates included the retina expressed 
PDCD6IP
, the circadian rhythm gene 
PER3
, and 
P4HTM
, which affects eye morphology. Future work will include functional studies and validation. Identification of genes contributing to refractive error and future understanding of their function may lead to better treatment and prevention of refractive errors, which themselves are important risk factors for various blinding conditions."
